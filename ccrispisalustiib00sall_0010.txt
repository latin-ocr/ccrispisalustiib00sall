vi THE PREFACE.

Charatters were as oppostte to one another as black''and ζ
white, in the Manner our Author has dones* was . vile ’
Daubing, setting a Gloss upon tlze most extreme ched- s
nest, to give it tlte Air and Lustre of Virtue and com·

mendable Accomplzffiments. '

ΒΗΤ this, indeed, is the only Flaw in our Author of Δ
any Importance, or worth while to trouble the Reader
about, tlzat I know of. As to the Matter of las Hillory,
it is remarkable and engaging enough. Catiline's Con·x ’
spiracy was such a villainous, desperate Design, as· is ¹
scaree to be parallelled in tlze History of Mankind, unless
by the murtherous Projefft's contrived by tlze Roman Ca- .
tholics in Favour of their Religion, as they call it, espe- “
'cially that famous Plot here in England against King. ,
]ΑΜΕ5 the First and his Parliament. ¹

Τ ΗΕ War against King Jugurtha too, for tlte ‘T ime χ
of its Continuance, is as full of important and remarkable '
Incidents as any otlzer in vtlte whole Roman History befides.
We see there to what a Hezglzt Bribery and Corruption
were at that Time got in Rome3 to such a Hezglzt indeed,>
that tlte Romans wanted but one Thing to complete their
Shame and Ruin at once, that is, to have had the Bill
'which was preferred to the People against the Perfioners
to tlte King rejebted. And tlzis was what many of the
Senate (in all likelibood a very great Majority) endea- ι
voured by clandestine Means and sty Praetices to bring
about3 but the People, corrupt as they were, yet were
net wicked and fhameleſs enough to come into'so vile a
Projebt‚ which, had it ‘sz‘tceeeded9 must in all Probability
'have made Jugurtha Master of Rome. To conclude,
we may learn, from this and the subsequent Part of the.
Roman Story 'till Julius Caesar executed his long-proa-¹ Ἴ
jetted Dcstgn upon his Country‚ this Leffon, that where
Bribery and Corruption prevail amongst the Go-

vernens

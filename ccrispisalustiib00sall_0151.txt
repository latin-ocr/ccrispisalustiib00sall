laid close stege to the town, and
endeavours, by means os visae,
towers, and elzgiaes of all forts,
to take it3 making all the haste
he could to be affore-hand with
the deputies he heard had been

sent to Rome by Atherbal bef re the

battle. But, after the senate were

informed of this war, three young ¹

gentlemen were dffat’checl by them
into Afric a, with orders to apply
to both kings, and acquaint them,
That it was the pleasure of the
senate and people of Rome, they
should both be quiet, and decide
their disputes in the way of reason,
and not of war, as what would

be more for the honour of the v

Romans and themselves t00.

upon hearing the deputies, replied,
That he was ready to pay the
utmost deference to the authority
of the senate 3 he hud endeavour-
ed from his youth to behave in
such a manner as to gain the ap-
probation of the best of meu, and
had recommended himself to the
favour of that great man P. Sci-

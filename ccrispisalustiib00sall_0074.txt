then the day of eleb‘t't'on came,

and Catiline found that neither

his suit for the consulship, nor

his plot for aſjt'ffna'ting the con—

sul in the field eff Mars, suc-

ceeded, he resolved upon open war,

and to try ὣ utmqst‘ extremity 3 ’
since all his underhand centrivances

had miserably miscarriedss

XXVIII. Accordingly he dis-
patched away C. [Manlius to Fae-
sulae, to take care ⁰f his concerns
there, and in the neighbouring
parts to Etruria ; one'Septimius
Camers into the territory of Pi-
cene3 and C. Julius intq Apulia.
Others likewise he sent ff ane
one ῖυαγ, and another another,
where he :bought they might 'be
most‘subservient to his de tgn. In
the mean time he ‘was carrying on
several projebh, one to murder
the consul 3 another to fire the city3,
another to secure proper places with
an mmcd force. He had always*
α swerd about him, and ordered
the rest to be provided after the
same manner 3 and clefired them to
be always ready and prepared sor
aerim. Iure was day and night
in α hurry, got little steep‚ and yet
was not fatigucd with the want
of it, or all the pains he under-
went. finally, when all his en·-
deavours proved ubertim, he again*
summam the principal of the con-
spirators, hy M. Porcius Laecea‚ >
to repair to his house in the dead]-
time of the night ; and there.
complaining heuvily of their waizt'
(gf spirit and aestivity, he irfiyms!

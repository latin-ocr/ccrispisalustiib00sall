ADISSERTATION‚&c. xvii

'sense of a Word, the better they will remember it. As
much as to say, that the less Busmess they do, the greater
Progress they will make 3 which I sear is too ridiculous to pass
with any body. The turning over the Leaves of a Diffiona-

i's it then that is os Use for fixing the Meaning of a Word in the
Memory? 'Tis plainly nothing but seeing it in the Dieno-
nary, and repeating it over and over again. And is there any
thing of Charm in the Name of a Dictionary, that the seeing
the Meaning of a Word in a Transsation running in a Co-
lumn along with the OrIginal, join'd with the like Repetition

- of it, should not produce the same Effe& and conduce as
much to fix it in the Memory ? The Reading a VJ ord three
or four Times over in a Diffionary‚ you say, will make a

strong Impression upon the Mind. Will not Reading the same

Word as often over in any other Book, under any other De-

nomination, produce the like Impreffion ἓ If not, it must be

because the Leaf of a Dielionary, as such, has some strange
bewitching Virtue in it, a Power of operating upon the Mind‚
and affeeting it, which the Leaf of no other Book can possibly
have. Risum teneatis ?

I ΗΑνΕ likewise heard it alledged, ‘ That the Use of Tran-

‘ ssations will make Boys idle 3' an Allegation more ridicu-
lous, if poffible, than the former. As Boys’ Busmess is by the
Use of Transsations rendered vastly more easy to them, if their
Tass< or Leffon is increased in Proportion, as it ought to be,

how is there any Encouragement given, or Allowance made,

for Idleness? Transsations are defigned to affist Boys in getting
their Lessons only, not in saying them to the Master. ln this
latter Case the Transsations are to be under close Cover, that,
by the Manner of the Boys acquitting themselves, the Master
may have Proof of their· Diligence‚ or the contrary. And if
the same Methods are taken to encourage Industry, and discou-
rage Idleness, where Boys are helped by a Transsation, as where

they have the Help of a Master, or are left to the Use of a
Dictionary, why should they not have the same Effeffl If
Sugar-Plums‚ Fruit, Play-things, or Half—pence, will make
Boys attend diligently to the Instruffions of a Master, or
thumb their Dictionary heartily, will they not operate as
strongly to make Boys diligent in the Use of a Translation?
Or, if Correetion be necessary‚ why should it not work up a

*Lad to Industry, as well where he has the Affistance of a
Transsation, as where he has not? W ill a Transsation make

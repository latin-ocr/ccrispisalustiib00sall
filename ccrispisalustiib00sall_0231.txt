live as if they despised the honours
you have to bestow, and yet sue
for them, as if they had lived ho-
nourably. Truly‚ they are much

'mistaken, who expe& at once two

things of very different nature, the
pleasure of idlenesS‚ and the re-
wards of virtue. And when they
harangue too before you, or in the
senate, they are ever running out
into the praises os their ancestors,
and think they receive a lustre from
the relation of their noble a&ions;
whereas it is quite the reverse. For
the moreillustrioustheirliveswere‚
the more scandalous is the base be-
haviour of these their descendants.
And indeed the case is thus. The
glory of the antients is a light
held out before their posterity, that
suffers neither their good or ill qua-
lities to be concealed. This is what
Ι want, gentlemen. But I can tell
you of something else, which is
much greater, my own actions.
,Now mind how unreasonable they
are. What they arrogate to thern·
selves from the noble behaviour
of others, that they will not allow
meto reap from my own3 sor no
other reason truly, but that Ihave

no images of my ancestors to shew‚ and because my nobi-
lity is of very late date ; which it is certainly better for a
3 man to be the founder of in his own family than to be a
disgrace to that received from his ancestors.

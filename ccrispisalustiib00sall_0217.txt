LXXVIII. After this defeat,
Jugurtha ³ despairing more Hyan
ever offizncst, got ⁰.ff with some
daserters‚ and a part of the horse,
into the clefirtss from whence he
came to Thala, a great and weal-
thy town ; where most of his trea-
sure loy, and his sons were gene-
rally educated. Upon advice oJ‘
which, Metellus, tho’ all the coun-
try betwixt Thala and the next
river, of fifty miles extent, was
dry and waste3 yet in hopes of
finishing the war, {f he could but
make himself moster of that town,
he rqsblves to encounter all manner
of harclships, and conquereven na-
ture itself. therefore he orders
all the beasts os burden to ber cased
of all their luggage‚ in order to
carry corn fiffcient for ten days,
with leothern bottless ond other
vffls proper to put up water in.
ffiloreover, he picks up out of the
country as many hor-ses, and the like
{mimals tlmt had been brebe, as he
could ; and louds them with vqffl'ls
of all kinds, but mtssly cf zewd,
taken out of the cottages of the
Numidiafzs. Bcfides, he orders the
neighbouring people, who, after the
defeat of the Χίης, hadficbmitted to
Metellus, to camy every one of them
as much water as they could ; (md
clppoints time (md place for their
rendczvous. He loads the oeasts of
carriage out of the river, which,
we have above said, was the nI'gh-
(st water· to the town. Being thus
provided, away he marchcs jor

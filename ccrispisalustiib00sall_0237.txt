BELLUM JUGURTHINUM

‚ soon as they heard of Marius's ar-

233

revel, retired dffrent :ways into
places ofdg'fficult accessn This was
Jz'tgurtha's contrivance‚ in hopes
that the enemy ina little time, by
not keeping close together, might
affird an opportunity of falling on
them to good advantage3 as suppo‘

⁷ fing the Romans, like most other

men, when their apprehenfions‘ of
an enemy were removed, would he

more loose and licentious. ν
XClll. ln the mean time Me-
tellus, upon his arrival in Rome,
was, contrary to his expec'z‘atiom,
very joyfully received ; being e-
qually acceptahle to the Commom,
and the Senate, now that the spi-
rit os envy had left them. But
Marius, with all poffihle applica·
tion and prudence, weighing well
the circumstances of the enemy, and
his own, discovered therchy what
was advantageoies for each, or
otherwise. He watched all the
movementsof the two Kings, ‘pre-
vented all their plots and defigns ;
sufflred no remiſjness in his own
men, or security with the enemy.
Accordingly he had ostentimes,
when upon cz march, attacked ond
routed, both the Getulians and
Jugurtho‚ τις they were making off*
with the spoils they hod got 'from
our allies3 and dzsaer med the -King
himself, not far from the town of
Cirta. But finding all this, how
specious an appearance soever it
made, availea' nothing towards
bringing the war to a comlufion,
he resolvecl to invest all the sities
that, by their number queople and
fituation, gave the enemy an ad·

an army so corrupyied by ill discipline, should make so bad a

juventutem luxuria atque
avaritia cum superbia in-

aliena cupere3 pudorem,
pudicitiam, divina atque
humana promiscua, nihil

cum domos atque villas
cognoveris in urbium

sere templa deorum, quae
nostri majores, religiosis-
sumi mortales, fecere.
Verum illi delubra deo-

wcsted all before them, and never
fhtified with what was thei r
own, were ever longing for what
was not3 trampled upon mod sty,
friendfhip, chastity‚ and every thing
else, divine or human, without

restraint, had not the least care
or concern for any thing that was
good. It is worth while to take a
view of the fine houses in town
and country, and then to vistt the
temples of the gods, built by our
fhrefathers, the most religious of
mankind. But they graced the
temples of the gods with their
piety, and their housts with glory ;
and took nothing from those they
conquered, but the licence of doing
mischief. But those I spoke of
above, the most worthless of men,
have in the most wicked manner
ravished from our allies all the

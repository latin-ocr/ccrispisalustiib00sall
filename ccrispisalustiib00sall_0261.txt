CXIII. Bocchus, &upon advice
of this, requested o Marius, by
a letter, to send Su la to him, that
he might advise with him about
their common concerns ; who was
sent accordingly, with a guard of
'horst and foot, Balearianjlingers,
bowmen, and α battalion‘ of Pe-
lignians, with arms used by the Ve-
lites, for the hester expedition in
their march, and because they would
be as well ficured by that sort of
arms, as any other, against the
enemies, who used the like them-
selves. Upon the fifth day of their
march, Volux, theson of Bocchus,
all on a sudden appeared upon a
wide plain, with no more than a
thousand horst, but who, by the
loose order of their march, gave
occafion to Sulla, and all that were
with him, to imagine them to be
more numerous, and enemies too.
Whereupon, every man now
stands to his arms, ready to receive
them. Their hopes, however,

to engage with an enemy which
they had often conquered. In the
mean time, fhme horse being sent
to reconnoitre them, bring word
again how the matter was, and
that there was no danger.

tells him, that he had been sent by
his father to meet him, and to wait
upon him with· that guard to his
court. Accordingly they continue
their march together, sor that ancl

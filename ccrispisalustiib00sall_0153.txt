XXVI. ’Tis no fault of mine,
illustrio'us fathers, that Itsouble
you with such frequent mess'ages ;
but Ι am obliged to it by the vio-
lence of Jugurtha, who is so mad-
ly bent upon my destrucffiom that
he has no regard to you or the
immortal gods, but had rather
have my blood than all things in
the world befides. And therefore
I, an ally and friend ofthe Roman
people‚ hove been closely besieged
for five months together3 whilst
neither the services of my father
Micipsa, nor your decrees, avail
at all to my relief. Iam unable to

from enlarging in my complaints
against Jugurtha. I have found by
experience, the unfortunate have
but little credit. But, however,
I arn senssble he has somethitig in
view beyond my destrufflom and
never expecsts to enjoy yourfriend-
ship and my kingdom together
Which of the two he is most arn-
bitioussy fond of can be no secret
to any body. For he first of all
murdered my brother Hiempsal,
and then forced me from my fa-
ther’s kingdom. Let those be 236ss

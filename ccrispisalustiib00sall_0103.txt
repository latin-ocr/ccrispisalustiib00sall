BELLUM CATILINARIUM.

ΞΕ merito dicere fieri.
Post, ubi paullatim licen-
tia crevit, juxta bonos
{3² malos lubidinose inter-
ficere, caeteros metu ter-
rere'. Ita civitas, servi-
tute oppreffa, stultae laeti-
tiae gravis peenas dedit.
Nostra memoria victor Sul-
Ia', cum Damasippum &2⁹
alios hujusmodi, qui malo
reipublicae creverant, jugu-
larijufflt, quis non factum
ejus laudabat ἕ Homines
scelestos ὅ factiosos, qui
(editionibus rempublicam
exagitaverant, merito neca-
tos ajebant. Sed ea res
magnae initium alodis fuit.

Namque, uti quzsque domum¹

aut villam, postremo aut
vas autvestimentum alicujus
concupiverat, dabat operam,
uti is in proscriptorum nu·
mero fft. Ita illi, quibus
Damastppi mors laetitiaesu-
erat, paulo post ipsi trahe-
bantur. lVeque prius finis
iugulandi fuit, quam Sulla
omnisfitos divitiis explevit.
Atque ego hoc non in M.
Tullio, neque his tempori-
bus vereor. Sed in magna
civitate multa ξδ’ varia in-
geniaszsssunt. Potest 'alio
tempore, alio consule, cui
item exercitus in manu stt,
fassum aliquid pro vero cre-
di. Ubi hoc exemplo, per
senati decretum, consid gla-
dium eduxerit, quis illi fi-
nem statuet, aut quis mo-
derabitur ?

joiced at, and said was right pro-
ceeding. But presently, as this
humour grew upon thern, they
proceeded to put good and bad
p'romiscuoussy to death at their
pleasure, and filled the rest with
apprehensions of the like usage.
Thus the poor city being mise-
rably enssaved suffered sufficiently
for their filly rejoicing. In our
times too, when Sulla, after his
success in the-war, ordered Darna-
fippus, and some others like him,
who had raised themselves by the
misfortunes of their country, to
be put to death, who did not com-
mend him for it? Every body
said, that those wicked facitious
rascals‚ who had plagued the pub-
lick by their seditious practices,
were deservedly put to death. But
that was the first part only ad'ted
in one of the most bloody scenes
that ever was. For, as any of the
party chanced to take a fancy for
any gentleman's house in town or
country,naybut any piece of plate,
or fine coat, he took care to get
him put upon the list of the pro-
scribed. Thus they who rejoiced
at the death of Damasippus were
themselves soon after hurried away
to execution. Nor was there any
end of this butchery, 'till Sulla
had glutted all his followers with
riches. 1 apprehend indeed nothing
like this in Mark Tully, or these
times. But in a mighty state there
are many various humours. At
another time, another consul, who
{hall have an army at his com·
mand, may be under a mistake;
and then, when upon this prece-

dent the consul shall by a vote of the senate draw the 1word,

who shall stop, or over-rule it ,Ρ

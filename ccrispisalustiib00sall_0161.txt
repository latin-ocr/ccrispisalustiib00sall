BELLUM JUGURTHINUM. 157

,Be-stiae, hujuscemodi ver-
bis disseruit.

XXXIII. Multa me
dehortantur a vobis, Qui·
sites, ni studium reipub-
licae omnia superet3 opes
fac‘i‘ionis, vestra patien-
tia, jus nullum3 ac max-
ume, quod innocentiae plus
periculi, quam honoris,
fst. IVam illa quidem
piget dicere, his annis
xv. quam ludibrio fueri-
tis superbiae paucorum3
quam foede, 'quamquam in-
nulti‚ perierint vestri de-
finsares 3 uti vobis animus
mh ignavia atque stcordia
corruptus fit3 qui ne
lvnunc quidem obnoxiis ini-
lmicis exsurgiti53 atque
ettam nunc timetis eos,
quibus vos decet terrori
ff. Sed quamquam hac*
talia sunt3 tamen obviam
ire faHionis potentiae α-
nimus subigit. Certe ego
dibertatem, quae mihi a
'parente meo tradita est,
essperiar 3 verum id fru-
lstra, an ob rem faciam,
i'n vestra manu fitum ss,

Quirites.

XXXIV. IVeque ego
vos hortor, quod Jaepe ma-

made on this occasion3 that I mean,
which he made in an affimbly of
the paple, after the return of Bes-
tia, in thefhllowing words.
XXXIH. Many things would
discourage rne from applying to
you, as Ι now do, gentlernen, did
not a regard for the good of the
publick prevail with me above all
other confiderations. The things
I mean, are, the power of the
faction of the-nobles, your tarne
submissum, and want of authori-
ty3 and above all, that innocency
is now attended with more danger,
than honour. For it is really irk-
some to me to remind you, how
insolently you have been treated
by some great mensor these fifteen
years last, and how basely the pa-
trons of your cause were taken off,
without the least punishment in·

flffi'red upon those that were guilty
of it, :18 also what a mean dastard-

ly spirit you ssmw, who stis not in
yourowndefenceFevennow when .

your enernies are at your mercy3
and are afraid of those, to whom

you ought to be a terror. But tho'

matters be thus, yet l arn determi-
ned to make a stand against the

power of the faetion. I will try at
least, the liberty that has been left
me by my father3 but whether
that my endeavour {hallbeattend-

ed with success, or not, must de-

pend entirelyu ponyou‚gentlernen.

XXXIV. Yet dol not advise

you to what your forefathers osten

'ores vestri fecere, uti did, that is, to do yourselves ju-

vnfra injurias armati

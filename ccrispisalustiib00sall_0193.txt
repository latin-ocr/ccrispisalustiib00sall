was, that not a man of the Numi-
dians attends their prince upon a
defeat, excepting his own horfi—
guards, but go where they please.
Nor is this any blemrssn upon their
honour at all, as being the fashion.

Wherefore Metelms perceiving the
King’ s spirit to bestzll wzdannted,

and that the war was like to
grow upon him again, which could
not be carried on but as Jugurtha

an equal footing with the enemy in
the contest3 that they szstained less
damage by a defeat, than his metz
did by a viatory, he resolved not to
carry on the war in the way of
pitch’d field—battles, hut aster a

of age to be put to the sword,

sons were likewise placed where
occasion required. Which things

struck a much greater terror into

the King, than the late unfortu-
nate battle had done. For he,
whose hopes lay entirely in avoieling

his naked back, that had no eyes in

he orders Volux, as affing like a
base enemy, to be gone out of the
camp. He, with tears in his eyes,
begs o him, not to harbour any

,such suspicion of him, that no·

thing of all this was owing to any
baseness of his, but to the subtlety
of jugurtha only ., who had by hig

which reason, he thought theirbest
way would be to take their rout
fairly throuoh the middle of his

his Moors before, or leave thern

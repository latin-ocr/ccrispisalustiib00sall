iv THE PREFACE.

lius Caesar3 bat he might, notwithstanding, have eas ly
avoided that elevated epithet‚ s nce he has only given us

the Sense, and not the Words, of Caesar, whose Stile is ’

very diffei ent from that of his Speech in Sallust.‘1722·s‚
I say, z‘s a commendable Instance of his Inipartiality, ΓΤ
he was not at the writing reconcz iled to Cicero, as some

have imagined. But then, I think, he has failed as .

mach in his Parallel between Cato and Caesar. It is
an Ontrage upon common Sense to run a Parallel be·
twixt two Men of ficch opposite Charab‘t'ers so as to
leave it at last a disputable Point which was the greater
and better of the two ·, insomuch that any one who was
to know nothing of Caesar but by oar Author's Account
of him would certainly take him for a very worthy,
glorians Man, whereas his true Charatter is the reverse.
He was indeed a Person of vast Abilities 3 but then he
had nothing in him that bore any Resemblance of a V ir-
tne but what was direaly intended to promote the worst
and most wicked destgn that can enter into the Heart
of Man to conceive, the Destruction of the Liberties of
his Conntry. The Genercfity‚ Eaſjnefis, and Clemency,

oar Aztthor celebrates him for, were in him Arts or “

Tricks‚ prattised purely with a Vzew to acquire, and

secare to himself, the Poff ff on of an arbitrary Powe7
over his Fellow— Cz· tizen53 otherwise, he had so little

of those good Qalities separated from such a View,

that this genereus, eaſjae Gentleman would have made no Ξ

Scruple to have swept the Globe of the Earth of one

Half of its Inhabitants by ΡΓΓΓ and Sword, or any

other Methods of Destru ttion, in order to rule the Re-
mainder at' Pleasa re. And, to aste the W ords of Cato

in his Speech to the Senate‚ upon Occ as on of Catiline's .

Conspiracy, Sha 11 any one talk to me in this case of

Mildness and NIercy? Shall that Man be accounted or ’

stiled ri ld and memifnl ⁹&hose insatiable Thirst after

Power made him we ade thr oagh Seas of Blood to come >

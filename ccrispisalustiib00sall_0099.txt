ing is in any case duly applied, it
does its work effe-&uallv But if
paffion of any kind possesses the
mind, that rules, a man’s sense
or parts signify nothing. I could
bring many instances of kings and
states, that have by anger or pity
been led into pernicious mistakes.
But I chuse rather to take notice
to you of the behaviour of our
ancestorS, whetein they shewed a
noble self-denial. In the Mace-
donian war, which we had with
king Perses, the Rhodiam, a great
and flourissiing people, who had
been raised by the support of the
Romans, proved base and trea-
cherous to us. Yet when, upon
the conclusion of the war, the
case of the Rhodians came under
consideration, our ancestors‚ to
leave no pretence for saying that
the war had been undertaken out
of a covetous humour, more than
upon account of injury received,
pardoned them. In all the Car-
thaginian wars too, tho' that peo-
ple in time of peace, or ceffation
of arms, had been guilty of many
wicked things against us, yet our
ancestors never upon any occasion
returned thern the like usage, re-
garding more what was worthy of
themselves, than what might have
been fairly praffifised against them.
And in like manner ought you,
gentlemen, to take care, that the
wickedness of Lentulus and the
rest of the conspirators, have not
more influence upon you than
your own honour, and not gratify
your resentment at the expence
of your reputation. For if a pu-
nishment equal to their crime be

might easily get, and to greater Perfeffion, by the Help

their Busmess.

I MAY add t00, that, perhaps, not very manyMasters are

qualified to furnish their Scholars, in construing their Leffons
to them, with Words so fit and proper for their Purpose, as
Literal Transsations will, done by a Person qualified with a
competent Skill in the Language for the Work. If any one
wants to be convinced of this, let him make aTrial upon

some of the Claffick Authors already published with Literal ’
Transsations‚ Jfflz'n or Florus for Instance, by transsating ,

three or four Chapters together, and comparing what he does
with what is already done, and I doubt not, but he will receive

 

ample Satisfafflon of the Truth os what I have said. For

though he may find his Performance to have the Advantage
upon the Comparison, yet he will certainly find it cost him
:some Thought and Trouble here and there, to work it up
to that Perfeffion. For the Latin Idiom differs so widely
from the English, that it is no such easy Busmess‚ as some
may perhaps imagine, to transsate the Clafficks Literally‚ and Ξ
at the same Time with tolerable Justness and Proprietyae-of

Language, so as the English may bear a Reading, without ap-
pearing absolutely barbarous and ridiculous. It was this Dif-
ficulty of the work, I guess, which deterred those whose
proper Bufiness it was, from attempting it, and so has been

the principal, if not the sole Occafion, that our Schools have ,

not been long fince provided with that admirable and obvious
Help of Literal Transsations, so obvioussy such, that many

could not but be senfible of it, who ye‘t being deterred by the »

Difficulty of the Undertaking, and the Fear of Censure,

would not engage in the Task of supplying our Schools with ·

any thing in that Way. Now if this be the Case, if it be

no such easy Matter to transsate the Claffick Authors Literally‚ ,
with any tolerable Justness or Propriety of Language, must it x
not be a vast Advantage to many school-Martem, to be deli- .

vered from the Vexation of hunting forproper Words, and
ostentimes to no Purpose, by being provided with good Trans-
lations, just and exa& in their Kind ? In short, I shall be bold
{to say, that not only Boys, but Masters themselves may,

but had a great dealmore Canning, and much greater
Abilam, whereby he at length executed with Success
what the other ‚attempted only to ln‘s own Destruoi‘ionss
He was fhrewdly' suspeoled 4⁴0 be privy to Catiline’s
Defigii, and engaged in it·‚ and the great Concern he
shewed to save tlze rest of tlze Conspirators, makes it not

from his early Yoatlz to liis Deatlz, plainly demonstrate
that lzis Concern for thern proceeded not from any Ten-

Danger of being involved in Blood and Fire, and the
whole Commonwealtlz ready to be swallowed up in one
common Ruin‚ to stand dallying and dodging, as if all

such Laws, and left to ιιῧῗ by thal· of Nature or Reason,
whiclz allows of all ιλιι Methods of Violence and Force
that appear neceffary for ilie Preservation of tlze State
from tlze Destrueiion that tsszrealens it. Οτι-ἦκ’, in fhort;

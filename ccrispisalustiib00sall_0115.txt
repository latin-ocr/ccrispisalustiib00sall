the neighbourhood ⁶s Pistorium,

in order to make his way privately
through some narrow defiles into
‘Tr-ansolpine Gaul. But Q M‘e-
tellus Celer ’ωας posted with three
legions in the territory of Piceno,
who gueff⁷cl hy the streights Cati-
line was in, he hod such α defign,
as has been mentioned, in view.
W herefore, being informfd by some
deserters from him, of the rout
he had taken, he immediasely
march'd away, and encamp'd at
the bottom of the mountains, where '
he zoas to pass into Gaul. Nor
was Anthonyfnr ff who purszced
the enemy flying with little or no
baggnge, with a good army, α-
long the low country. But Cati-
line finding himself inclofid hythe
mountains, aad the enemy's troops
together, that all went wrong in
the city, and that there were no
hopes either of flight or desence
within walls, thinking it the best
way in such α case, to try the for-
tune os a battle, he restilv’d to en-
gage Anthony as soon as pffhle·
Wherefore, calling his army togeae
ther, he made them a speech to the

following purpose.

clausum, in urbe res adversas, neque fugae neque praesidii ul-
lam spem, optumum faeta ratus in tali re fortunam belli ten-

tare, statuit cum Antonio quam primum confligere.

ltaque,

concione advocata, hujuscemodi orationem habuit.

LX. Compertum ego
habeo, milites, verba vj-
ris virtutem non addere3
neque ex ignavo strenuum,
neque fortem ex timido
exercitum oratione impe-
ratoris fieri. ,Quanta cu·

LX. Iam very senfible‚ gen-
tlemen, that words cannot inspire
courage, and that an army of
lubbers will never become vigo-
rous and aetive, or of cowards
brave, by any thing a generalem
say to them. Just as much cou-
rage as nature or use has given a
man, will he {hew in time of bat-

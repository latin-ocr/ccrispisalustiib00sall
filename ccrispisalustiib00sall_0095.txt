the war, now changing their
mincis, began to culfi the defigns of
Catium, and to extol Cicero to the
heave7753 and, as being now se-
sured agaiifi the ssavery they were
threatened with, were full eff joy
and jellity. For the other abts of
war they thought might turn more
to their advantage than detriment 3
but the firing of the town they
looked upon as a cruel wild projecit,
and what would have been perni-
cious to them especially, whose βώ-
stance cotgfssed entirely in cloaths
and a few houshold goods. After
this, one Lucius Tarquinius was
brought before the frenate, who was
said to be going over to Catiline‚
and had been therefore brought back
to town. He offered to make a full
discovery of the plot, if he might
have the publick saith for his par-

don 3 and being thereupon ordered ,

by the consul to declare what he
knew, he gave much the· same in·-
formation Volturcius had done, as
to firing of the town, the defigned

enemy. He added, that he had
been dispatched by M. Crassus to
tell Catiline not to be frighted at
the seizing of Lentulus‚Cethegus‚
and others of the conspirators, but
make the more haste to town, for
the encouragement of the rest,
and for the release of those that
were prisoners. But when Tar-
quin named Craffus, a person of
the highest quality, a vast estate,
and mighty power3 some looking
upon what was said as immutate,
and others, though they believed it
true, yet because so powersul a
man was rather to bc wheedled

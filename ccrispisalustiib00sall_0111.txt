Alii alios increpantes ti-

mihi, multa legenti,

populus Romanus do-

LVII. After Cato sat down7‚

all the consular gentlemen‚ with
the greatest part of the rest, ap·
plaud his sentence, ancl extol his re·-
solution to the heavms, upbrat‘ding
and calling one another cowara's,
but magnifying ana celebrating
Cato for a hero. Accordingly a
vote pqſjed conformable to his ad-
vice. Now, as I have read and
heard much of the noble atchieve-
ments of the Roman paple, both
in peace and war, by sea and by
land, I had a mind to make a
strio? enquiry into the true spring
of all their mighty succ-cst. I was
Jetfible, they had ostentimes with
a handful of men engaged vcss
armies of their enemies. I was
not ignorant, they had carried on
wars against mighty princes with
smallforce53 and bqfides, had of-
tentz'mes felt the severest strokes of
ill fortune3 that the Greeks were
superior to them in eloquence, and
the Gaztls for reputation in war.
Upon clue conſsderation I found,
that the prodigieus hravery and
Ἴ conduc} os a few fine men did all,
and was the true cause that po· Δ
verty prevailed agaitfi riches, and
small numbers agaiaefi great. But
after the city became debauched
with luxury ancl idlenqſs, still the
commonwealth‚ by reason of its
grandem, was able to bear up
under all the vices of its com-
manders and magistralem but yet
Rome, like a woman cffite with
the productim cf a numerous broad,
did not for along time produce χο
much as one man of any extraor-
dinary charefflern But within the

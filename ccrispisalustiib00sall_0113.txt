LVIII. Postquam uti

postulabat, parare jubet.
Ipse, praesidiis dispositis,
*Lentulum in carcerem
deducit. Idem fit caeteris
per praetoreS. Est in car-
cere locus quod Tullia-
num appellatur, ubi paul-

LVHI. After the finate, as I
have said, gave into Caro's opi-
ηἱση, the consul thinking it the
best zvay to have the fintence exe·
cutecl that very night, which was
just at hand3 for sear of any ri-
sing in the city, in case of cle-lay,
orders the triumviri to have ai!
things ready for the same. ΗΔ
himself conduffis Lentulus to prison,
where he placed strong gamm-3
whilsz' the prators do the same by
the rest as the conspiratam. There
is α *place tn the jail called Tul-
lianum, upon α small rise to the
left hand, as one enters, which is
ssunk twelve foot within the earth,
secura-{l on aufidi-s by strong wallJ,
and a good arch ossione above,
but α nasty, dark, slinking, dis-
mal place. As soon as &vitulus
was let down into the same, the
executionem appointed for the pur-
pos} strunglfd him. Thus did that
gentleman of a patric-ian finnily,
the great family o the Cornelii,
who had been consu of Rome, come
to an end suited to his manners
ancl behaviour. Cethegus, Sta-
tilius, Gabinius, and Caepari-
us, were all puntfhed in the simu:
manner.

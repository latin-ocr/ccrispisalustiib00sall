you o ercame envy itself by your .
glory. Now, fince nature is just
putting an end to my life, I been
seech you by this right hand, by«,
the honour of a king too, len->2³
treat and beg of you, to love mys? l
children, your relations, and bro-'ful
thers by adoption3 and that youi 1
would not transfer your affefflomsl
to strangers, rather than keep ital!
fixed upon those who are united}
to you by blood. Armies and trea-fssss
sures are not the security of king-'fl
doum, so much as friends, whom}
you can neither force to be suchy
by arms, nor purchase with gold-3
Ί hey are only procured by good}
offices and fidelity. VVho Ιίὶιουῖἀςῇ
be more a friend than one brothenls
to another? Or what strangerwilllJ
you find faithful to you, if you arel
an enemy to your own relations Ee]
I deliver up to you a kingdomik
strong indeed, if you are good (οἶ
one another, but weak, il you arel
wicked- For small states grow*
great by unanimity, whilst great
ones come to nothing by discord.'
But it behoves you, Jugurtha,‘
more than they, who are both
older and wiser than they, to take
care and guard against any mis-
condu& in this affair. For in all
contesss, the moreopulent party,
though he really receive wrong,
yet, because he is the more power-
ful, is thought to do wrong. But
do you, Atherbal and Hiempsal,
respee‘t and reverence this worthy
man, imitate his noble behaviour,
and do your utmost, that the
world may not think I have a·
dopted a son preferable to those
nature bestowed upon me.

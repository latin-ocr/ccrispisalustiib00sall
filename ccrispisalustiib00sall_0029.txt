A DISSERTATioNJton. xxv

my Opinion, the Matter can admit of no Dispute amongst
Persons of any Sense or Confideration at all.

μ THE several Uses before-mentioned to be made of Clasfick
Auohors, published together with handsome elegant Transsa-
tions‚ {hew of what prodigious Advantage it would be to our
Grammar-Schools‚ to have some of the choicest among them
so published. Half a Dozen such thrown into our Schools,
and used there as they should be, would certainly work a won-
derful Effec't, such as would soon be very vifible all the Nation
over, by much greater and quicker lmprovement of Youth
in both the Languages of Latin and English together. Now
the Way of exercifing Boys in Clafficks so published would be
to make them get three or four Leffons in the Original‚ to read
ebxacff'tly into the Transsation‚ and, when that is done, to make
them go the same Leffons over again, and get the Transsation
to read as exaffly back again into the original Latin. This (Ι
say it again, 'and defire the Reader will take Notice of it)
will, in my Opinion, bethe most effeetual expeditious Method
to bring Youth to an easy elegant Use of both Languages‚ that
can poffibly be taken with them.

FROM the Whole of what has been said upon this Subje& Of
Transsations‚ I shall venture to draw this Conclufion, that a
lMan of but avery moderate Skill in the Latin Tongue may
:aequit himself, in the Teaching of it, by the Help ofrTranssa-
itions, with much greater Success, than the most able Critick in
'the Language can do without. I have had as much Experience
in the Bufiness of Education as most Men that have engaged
in it. I have taught in the common Method, and in my own,
so far as it was practicable, (for we are yet far from having all
the Clafficks published with Transsations that are necess'ary for
the Affistance of our Youth at School, to say nothing of other
‘Helps that are wanting) and I add τοο, that I have thought as
much upon the subjeet of Education‚ as perhaps any Man
whatever: and 1 do pretend to say, that, in the common Me-
thod of Education, where the Use of Literal Transsations is
disallowed‚ Youth must thereby alone suffer a Loss of at least
two Years' Time, upon a moderate Computation. So that
take two Boys of equal Age and capacity, and let one start

two Years before the other, in the reading of Authors‚ accord- ⁴

ing to the vulgar Way of proceeding‚ and I will be answerable “
for it, that the latter shall, by the Help of Transsations, in a
Year, or two at the most, clearly out-do vthe former, that had
so much the start of him. Now if this be s0‚ as Iam pretty
sure of it, here is two Years’ Time quite lost 3 to which if we

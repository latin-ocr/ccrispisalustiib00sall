said boaslingly of himself, and that
heartily vexed them. But the mu-
king of due preparations for the
war was his principal care. He
demanded reciuits sor the army ;
sent for auxiliary forces from kings
and states in alliance with us 3 par-
ticularly from Larium he summoned
the choicess men, mzst of them

known well enough in the army,

hut few elsewhere. He did like· ·

wise by his persuasions prevail
with old soldiers‚ that had served
up their time in the wars, to en-
gage in the service again. And tho'
the senate hated him, yet they durst
refuse him nothing 3 nay, they were ·
forward enough to vote him re-
cruits, because it was supposed the
commenalty would not much care
for the service, and so Marius
would either not be able to make
his levies, or incur their dtspleasure
bysb doing. But herein they were
baulked, so fond were moll of them
of going along with Marius, each
man flattering himself with the
hopes of returning home vinariam,
and enriched with the spoils of
war, or of other such-like advan-
tages. And [Marius had, by a speech
of his to them, contributed not a
little to the rag'fing of such expet‘ia-
tions in them. For resolving, af-
ter what he defired had been voted
sor him, to raise recruits, hesum-
moned the people to an uffimbly, as
well to encourage them to favour
his defign, as to take occaſson, ac·
cording to his custom, of inveigh-
ing against the nobility. Both which
he did in the following manner.

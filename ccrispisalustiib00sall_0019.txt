from Literal Transsations of Claffick Authors.

ΙΙ. As to the Use of a Dictionary. That Way is yet
more improper than the former. Young Boysare but very

aukward at finding Words in a Dictionary, which Work ’

will consequently make a sad Consumption of their Time,
a fingle Word requiring as much as will suffice them for the
., getting two or three Lines perfetffly to construe by the Help
of arLiteral Transsation. And then what a tedious while
must they be in getting so many Lines t‘o construe by the
ι Use of a Dictionary, where they may have Occasion, as
must often happen‚ to look out half a Dozen words or more
for that Purpose? Does not the Absurdity of such a Method
of Proceeding stare the Reader in the Face? And how can
Gentlemen be easy in having their Sons carried on in a
Way so manifestly* trifling? Which will appear yet more so,
when it is considered, that young Boys can indeed make but
little Use of a Dictionary, for want of Sense to distinguilh,
amongst the various Significations many Words have, such
as are proper for their Purpose3 not to say too, that the best
DictionarIes will in this Case frequently fail them. But
suppose all this was otherwise, yet by what Kind of Con-
juration must young Lads, betwixt Ten and Fourteen‚ 'un-
ravel that perplexed Order of Words in the Latin'Tongue?
This they can never do, give them what Instruffions you
will for it, 'till they come to have a pretty general Know-
ledge of VVord33 so as that, upon reading a Sentence once
or twice ssowly and attentively over, they either discover the
Sense, or cerne pretty near it. ‘I'hat alone, and not any
Directjons you can give Boys so young, will enable them to
unravel the intricate Order Words usually have in the Latin
Tongue. Now Literal Transsations dire& them immediately
to the Order in which Words are to be taken, and at the
same Time immediately supply them with the Meaning of
such Words as they want to know the Meaning of. All
that has been said upon this Head appears to me so very evident
and incontestable, that, for my Part, I see not how it can be
disputed by any one.

111. THERE is, then, no other proper Help left for young
Lads in the Reading of Authors, for the first three οιᾷἰυτ
Years at least of their being> at School‚ but that of Literbl
Translations. If Boys, who cannot conjure to come at the
Meaning of Words, must be helped to the Meaning of them
some Way or other, is not thp3 most easy and expeditioris Wxssy

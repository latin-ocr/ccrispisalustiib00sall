fortune is there the least licence
allowable. In that there must
be no party-prejudice, or hatred,
and paffion least of all. What
is called anger upon other occa-
fions, in persons invested with great
power, goes by the name of pride
and cruelty. Truly‚ gendemen, I
am of opinion, that no punishment
can be thought of bad enough for
their crimes. But most men re-
member the upshot of thingS, and
in the case of villains, forgetting
theirwickedness, talk only of their
punishment, if that be a little too
severe. I am well affured that
the worthy brave gentleman D.
Silanus said what he did out of
zeal to the publick service,with0ut
the least regard to favour, or ill-
will to any one: such is his virtue
and modesty to my knowledge.
But his advice appears to me, not
cruel indeed‚(for what can becruel
against such wretches?) but not
agreeable to the proceedings of
o'ur government. For certainly,
Silanus, either your fear, or the in-
jury defigned the publick, moved
you to advise a punishment un·-
known to our laws. As to your
fear, I need say nothing, especially
since, by the diligence of our glo-
rious consul, so sufficient a force
has been provided for our security.
And as to the punishment,wemay
say indeed, what is the truth in
reality, that in a state of mourn-
ing and misery‚ death is a deli-
veranee, not a punishment. That
puts an end to all the miseries of
mankind, beyond which there is
no roorn for either sorrow or joy,
But by heaven, tell me why did

in my present distress. And m de· ’ᾗ

the present contented myfelf with?³
the satisfae tion arismg from a con-*1⁸⁴
sciousness of my innocence,Which ’ἑ

real. Provoked by injuries andi(
indigniti s, in being robbed of the
fruits os my labour and industry‚¹5 Ἰ
and not suffered to keep the h0-³
nourable station that belonged tol
me, 1 publickly undertook the⁴
cause of poor oppress'ed people,
agreeably to my former way of
life. Not but that I could have
satisfied my own creditors out of
my own estate, whilst the genero·- ·“
fity of Orestilla would have done·
the same for others my friends
out of her own and her daughter’ s
estate. But finding worthless men
advanced to places of trust and¹
power in the government, and
my self set afide upon a groundless‘
suspicion, I have, I think, confi-
dering my circumstances, pursued'
means honourable enough for ὼε
preservation of the remainder of
dignity left me. I should have·

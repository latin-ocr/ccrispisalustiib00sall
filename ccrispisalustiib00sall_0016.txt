have negletsted what was equally necessary, the Care of
Youth : For had but this been as duly attended to as the Impor-
tance of the Matter required, their Labours would have been
of vastly more Use to the World. Gramma, and Notes
,upon Authors‚ we have indeed in Abundance, and more by far
than are good for any Thing3 yet these, where they are useffll,
are only so to such as have made a confiderable Progress in
the Latin Tongue. But Beginners have been left wholly
without any proper Helps⁹ 'till of late some few have been
provided for them by one engaged in the l-aborious and trou-
blesome Employment of teaching Schoel, who consequently
had both less Time and less Ease of Mind for that Work
than many others better qualified to promote a rational* Method
of Education amongst us, had they been please'd to turn their
Thoughts upon the Subjed’t, and push the Matter, by sup-

plying our Schools with proper Books for the Purpose. But .

the Learned, it seem8‚ have thought Things of this Kind
below their Notice. There was more Credit and Fame to be
got by variting for Men than Children 3 and therefore the
latter have been strangely neglelsted. ⁴ ,
As the Course of Life l was severa} Years' engaged in

Schools. What l have there said, and elsewhere, upon thes

Usefulness of Transsations sor the easy and exped-'rtious Aitain-
ment of t'he Latin Torrgue‚ I have thought proper, in ¹this

Poeface, to draw together under one View‚ in order to tur-n·

more effeftually the Attention of the Publick upon a Matter
of such great and general Concern.

TRANSLA'rtoNs are of tvvo Kinds, or there are two
Ways of transsating Authors for the Use of Schools3 the
one Literal or Ver-bal, in- which the Latin is rendered into

English Word for Word, ot the Sense and Meaning of every s

Word in the Original· is given in the Transsation ς the other
Free and Proper, wherein Regard is only had to the Sense,
which the Transsator endeavours to express inwhe most just
and handsome Manner, without pretending to give the pre-
cise Meaning of every individual Word, as in the Literal or
Verbal Way.‘ Now both these Sorts of Transsations are so
highly and apparently useful for the ready Attainment of the
Latin Tongue‚ that it is really amazing the World should
not long since have been scnfible of it: And it is yet more
amazing, that after so much has been said upon the Subje&,

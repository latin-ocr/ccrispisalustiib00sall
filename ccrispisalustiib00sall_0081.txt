BELLUM CATILINARIUM. 77

obtestamur, consulatis mi-
seris civibu53 legis praest-
dium, quod iniquitas prae-
toris eripuit, restituatis .-
neve nobis eam neceffitu-
dinem imponatis, ut quae-
ramus, quonam modo,
maxume ult-i sanguinem
nostrum pereamus.
XXXV. Ad haec Q
Marcius respondit: Si
quid ab senatu petere vel-
lent, ab armis discedant,
Romam supplices proficis-
cantur. Ea misericordia
atque mansuetudine sena-

tum populumque Roma· ⁶

num semper fuisti, ut ne-
mo unquam ab eo frustra
auxilium petiverit. At
Catilina ex itinere pleris-
que consularibus, praete—
rea optumo cuique literas
mittit: Se, salsts crimini-
bus circumventum, quo·
niam fabiioni inimicorum
refistere ³nequiverit‚ [ον-
tunae cedere, Maffiliam in
exfilium proficisci .· non
¹quo fibi tanti sceleris
confi-ius effit, sed uti res-
publica quieta foret, neve
ex sua contentione seditio
oriretur. Ab his longe
diversas literas Q Ca-
tulus in senatu recitavit;
quas fibi nomine Catilinae
redditas dicebat. Earum
exemplum infra scriptum
est. ³

Ξ Catulo, S. E gregiavtua

fore beg of you and the senate, to
take the care of us your fellow-
citizens under consideration, and
restore us the prote&ion of the
law, which the iniquityof the Prae-
tor has taken from us 3 and that
you would not lay us under a ne-
ceffity ofconsidering how we may
sell our lives at the dearest rate.
XXXV. To this Q Marcius
made anfioer, If they had any
thing to request of the lenate, they
ought to lay down their arms, and
apply with all due submiffion to
Rome. That the senate and peo-

ple of Rome had alway {hewn

themselves os somild and merci-
fula dispofition‚ that no one ever
applied to them for their affistance
in vain. But Catiline in his jour—
neysent letters to most of the consu-
lar gentlemen in Rome, especially
those of the best charaHer among st
them, stgnifying, That whereas he
had been on all hands persecuted
with charges of a heinous nature,
utterly false, and found it impos-
sible to stand against the fadiion of
his enemies, he submitted to his
fate, and was going to Marseilles‚
to spend his days in banishment
there 3 not that he was conscious
to himself of the villainy he was
charged with, but in regard solely
to the quiet of his country, and
to prevent the disturbance his con·
testin'g with his enemies might oc·
casson. But Q Catulus read in
the finan-house, a letter quite dif-

, ferent from all these, which he said

was delivered him as from Catiline5
a copy eff which follows.

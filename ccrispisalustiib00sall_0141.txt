XVII. Finally, worthy fathers,
Nlafiniffa's instrufflon to our fa-
mily ever was, to make no court
to any but the Roman people, to
engage in no alliances or treaties
with any other power whatever ,
alledoing that we should find a·
bundantsecurity' in yoursriendship
alone3 but that, if fortune {hould
turn upon the Roman power to
its destruction, we must then of
neceffity perish with it. By your
own good conducffiand the favour
of the gods, you are great and
mighty 3 success and submiffion
attend you throughout the world,
whereby you are enabled to redress
with ease the mjuries of your al-
lies. All thatI fear ιη the case is,
lest the friendffiipofJugurtha with
particular members of this state,
to whom he is not sufficiently
known, should misguide them in
their conduc} upon this occasion 3
who, I am informed, are usmg
theirutmostendeavours,solliciting
and importuning you by a very
particular application‚ not to pro-
cecd to any resolution against him,
as he is not here himself, without
a full hearing of his cause, ’Tis
said, that what I alledge is pre-
tence only3 as if I had not been
forced to fly my kingdom, but
might have continued in it ifI
Heavens grant I could
but see the man,by whose impious
violence I have been plunged into
my present misery, dissembling as
I do 3 and that at last either you,
or the immortal gods, would take
the affairs of mankind under your
care. Then would the wretch‚

{ho now prides and triumphs in

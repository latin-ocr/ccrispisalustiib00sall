time, hunger and fatigue. With
these leffons {hall I animate my
soldiers Nor {hall I treat them
hardly, but myself with indul-
gence, or make their toil the mat·
ter of my glory. This manner of
command is useful and modest.
For to keep the soldiery, by seve-
rity, to stri& discipline, whilst you
take your ease yourself, is to a&
the partofa tyram, not a general.
By this and the like conda& did
your ancestors render themselves,
and the Roman state, famous in
the world3 which our nobility
depending upon, tho' nothing like
them in their behaviour, despife
us that follow their glorious ex-
ample, · and demand from you all,
places of power and trust, not up-
on the foot of merit, as having de-
served them, but as other wja s
their due. But those haughty gen-
try are very widely mistaken.
Their ancestorsleft them all they
could3 siches, images‚ and their
own glorious memory. ssut did
not leave them their noble qua-
liti-⁶:33 nor could they. Those are
neither given, nor received.

XC. They upbraid me as a
rough unpolifhed mortal 3 because
Iam not nice in my entertain-
ments, or have a player, or cook,
of higher pxice th‘an my steward3
all which I v ery frankly own, gen-
tlemen. ForI have learnt from my
father, and other excellent per-
sons, that niceness belongs to ναο-
men, rugged ind ustry to men;
and that the brave ought to excel

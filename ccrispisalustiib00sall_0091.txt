³ BELLUM CATILINARIUM

XLV. Sed Allobroges,
ex praecepto Ciceronis,
per Gabinium caeteros
conveniunt: ab Lentule,
Cethego, Statilio, item
Caffio postulant jusjuran-
dum, quod signatum ad
civis perferant: ali-ter

haud facile eos ad tantum
⁷ negotium impelli posse.
Caeteri nihil suspicantes
’ dant. Caffius semet eo
brevi venturum pollice-
tur, ac paullo ante lega-
tos ex urbe proficiscitur.
Lentulus curn his T.
Volturcium quendam
Crotoniensem mittit, uti
Allobroges, prius quam
domum pergerent, cum
Catilina, data atque ac—
cepta fide, societatem
confirmarent. Ipse Vol-
turcio literas ad Catili-
‘nam dat3 'quarum ex-

ergtiplum infra scriptum
e .

¹²Quis fim, ex eo, quem·

ad te misi, cognosces.
Fac cogites, in quanto ca-
lumitate fis, ὅθ’ memine-
ris, te virum effi.
stderes, quod tuae ratio—
‘unes postulent. Auxilium

data verbis dat ; cum ab
senatu hostis judicatus fit,

diet. In urbe parata eff’,

Con- ·

XLV. But the Allobroges, ac-
cording to Cicera's hestruttions,
procured hy Gabinius's means, a
meeting ‘tuith the rest of the con-
spirator-s, at which they infisled
upon an ooth from Lentulus, Ce-
thegus, Statilius and Coffius‚ uto-
cler their hands and sauls, to carry
to their masters at home, pretend-
ing it would be otherwise impoffi'ble
to engage themvin (ιη affuit· of so
great importance 3 which the rost,
having no suspicion of their dessign
in it, readz'ly granted. But Caffius
affiered them he would be in their
country very speedily, und accord-
ingly left the town α little before
the ambafflzdors. Lentulus sent
along with them one T. Volturcius
(ff Croton, that they might further
ruti& what had been agreed on,
with Catiline himself, before they
went home ; and gave Volturcius
a letter for Catiline, α copy ‘f
wha'ch follows.

You will understand who I am
that write to you, by the bearer.
Consider the calamitous circum-
stances you arc in, and remember
you are. a man3 and consider fur·
ther too what your cause requires.
Seek affistance from people of all
conditions‚ even the meanest. He
moreover irfirutted V olturcius· to
ast: him, fince he was declared an
enemy by the senate, what he ·
meant by refusmg to accept of the
assistance of ssaves. That an things
in town were ready according to
his order; and therefore that he
ss10uld not delay to advance torth-

with. -

BELLUM JUGURTHINUM.

Metellum putat 3 per
magnas soiitudines cum

minum ferum, incultum-

Eorum *multitudinem in

Qam rem opportunissu-

quia singuli pro opibus,
quisque quam plurimas
uxores‚denas alis, alii plu-

this war, had fint embcffldors to
Rome, to treat upon an alliance

tie cf qffim'ty is little regarded
among the Numidiam ancl assoon,
because with them every man may
have as many wives as he ccm

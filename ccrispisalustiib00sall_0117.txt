BELLUM CATILINARlUM,

Ι vance the power of a few, which

thev have no need to do ; which
should encourage you to fall on
bravely. mindful of your former
courage. We might havelived 'm
banishnient, but with the utmost
disgrace. Some of you too might
have lived at R÷›me in ’.ι starving
condition, and a state of depen-
dance. But because those things
appeared dishonourable and intole-
rable to brave men, you resolved
upon the part you now aec. And
if you dessre to get out of your
present ill circumstances, courage
is the only way to it. None but
conquerors ever change war for
pe; ..ce For to expe& secur rity in
ssight, when the arms that should
secure a man are turned from the
enemy, is madnesS. The most
timorous are always in the most
danger in tirne of battle. Valour
is a wall of defence. When I
consider you, and your gallant-
behaviour, gentlemen, I am in
great hopes of vie'tory. Your
spirit, youth, and courage, give
me heart3 as also the necestity
you are under, which makes cow-
ards brave. For the narrowness
of the place we are to engage in,
secures us against being surround-
ed by the enemy 's numbers But
if fortune envy your bravery, be
sure you fall not unrevenged Suf-
fer not yourselves to be taken and
ssaughtered like cattle; but sight
like men rather, and leave the
enemy a bloody, and a sorrowful

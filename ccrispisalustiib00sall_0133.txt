BELLUM JUGURTHINUM.

XI. Ad ea Jugurtha,
tametsi regem fieta locu-
tum intelligebat, δε ipse
ionge aliter animo agita-
bat, tamen pro tempore
henigne respondit. Mi-
cipsa paucis post diebus
moritur. Postquam illi
more regio justa magni-
fice fecerant, reguli in
unum convenere, ut in-
ter se de negotiis cannis
disceptarent. Sed Hiemp-
sal, qni minumus ex illis
erat, natura ferox, etiam
antea ignobilitatem Ju-
gurthae, quia materno
genere impar erat, de—
spiciens, dextra Atherba-
lis adsedit3 ne medius
ex tribus, quod apud
Numidas honori ducitur,
Jugurtha foret. Dein,
tamen, ut aetati concede-
ret, fatigatus a fratre, vix
in alteram partem trans-
duE’cus est. Ibi cum mul-
ta de administrando irn-
perio differerent, Jugur‘

>oportere quinquennii con-
staelta ὃ decreta omnia

tempora confestum annis
Micipsam parum animo

empsal placere fibi re-
spondit3 nam ipsum illum

adoptatione in regnum
perveniffe. Qod ver-
· bum in pefi‘tus Jugurthae
t altius, quam quisquam
ratus erat, descendit.

XI. To this Jugurtha made a ·
very complaisant reply, suitable to
the occasion, though he was sensible
the king was far from being fin-
cere in what he said, and he him-
fils was as far from defigning
what he declared for. Micipsa
died a few days after. As soon as
the funeral solemnity‚ which was
very magnificent, was over, the
three princes met together, in or-
der to confer about the fittlement
of their affairs. But Hiempsal,
the youngest of them, being natu-
rally high-spirited, who had before
stighted Jugurtha for the meannefi
of his birth by the mother's fide,
placed himself on the right hand
of Atherbal, to prevent Jugurtha's
fitting himself in the middle be·-
twixt him and his brother, which
among st the Numidiam is reckoned
the most honourable pofition. And
it was with much ado he was pre-
vailed upon by the importunity of
his brother to pay a deference to
the age of Jztgurtha hy seating
himself on the other side. After
a great deal of discourse upon a
method osproceeding in the admi-
nstration of their kingdom, Ju-
gurtha, among other things, pro-
posed a repeal of all the resolu-
tions and appointments of the five
years foregoing‚ by reason Micip-
sa was at that time but in a doat-
ing condition. Hiempsal said he
was of the same mind 3 for his a·
doption had happened within that
time, to wit, about three years
before. IsVhichJaying sank deeper
into the mind of Jugurtha than
any one imagined. Theresore from
that daysorward, being perplexed

BELLUM JUGURTHINUM.

videtur Africae fitum pau-

cis exponere; & easgen- -

tis, quibuscum nobis bel-
lum aut amicitia fuit, at-
tingere. Sed quae loca &
nationes, ob casprem,
aut asperitatem, item so-
litudines, minus frequen-
tata sunt, de iis haud fa-
cile compertum narrave-

And bere, I judge, it may not be
improper to give α short account of
the situation of Africa, and of
those notiam we have had any war
oralliance with. But, assor those
parts and nations which, because
os their exceffve beat, their being

to the first inhabitants of this coun-
try, and those that in succeeding
ages settled there, and how they
incorporated, l shall gz've a very
brias account, dtfferent indeed from
the common one, but such as was
interpreted to me out of tlve Car-

XXXVI. But so violent is
their inclination to mischief that
the letting them go unpunished for
past crimes will avail you nothing,
unless the power of committing
the like be taken from them for
the future3 and you must live* m
perpetual anxiety‚ when you find
yourselves under a neceffity of be-
ing ssaves, or maintaining your li-
berty by force of arms. For what
hope rs there of preserving saith
or concord among us Ρ They are
defirous to lord it over you at
pleasure,you to be free3 they to
do mischief‚youtoh1nder1tFi·-
nally‚ they use your allies as ene-
mies, your enemies as allies. Can
there be any peace or frIendlhip
in minds so differently disposed?
Wherefore I advise and beseech
you, not to let such villainy go un-
puniihed. The case now before
you is not that> of robbing the
treasury‚ or oppreffing your allies,
Which tho' very grievous things,
yet are grown so faihionable that
they pass for trifles only. The
authority of the senate, and your
mighty power have been betrayed
to your most virulent enemy ; and
the commonwealth set to sale both
at home and abroad. And unless:
stri& enquiry be made into this
miscondu&, and the guilty be pu-
nished, what will be left for us,
but to live in a ssavish subjecffion
to the villains ? for to do with
impunity whatsoever a man plea-
ses is to be a king. Ι would ,not
hereby be thought to encourage
you to wish your senous-citizens
may be rather found guilty than

innocent 5 but only not to pardon
tc,

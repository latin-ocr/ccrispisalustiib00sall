THE PREFACE. ix

purfite the Defign st) closely as I wished, by reason of the
cumbersome Employment I had upon my hands, and being
upon another Account quite weary of the Bustness, I quitted
dt, in order to employ my Studies and Pen more effeetually
in carrying on a Destgn I had so much at Heart, with this
Afficrance, that, if my Sentiments upon· Education were
right, I could not be employed in any way more usteful to
the Publick‚ And that my Sentiments were just, or at least
that I was not greatly out, or widely mistaken, in the
'Method J proposed, I thoughts] had some Reason to hope,
from the great Approbation it met with from the most able
Judges up and down the Kingdom3 of which I had good
Affurance by Letters from fiveral of them, as well as other
Information. If, therefore, it should please God to continue
to me that fine State of Health I have hitherto enjoyed‚ ·
and Gentlemen will be pleased to encourage me in my Pro-
jebt, I shall spare no Pains to furnish our Schools with
,what further Helps are wanted in them. And I hope such
Gentlemen as have done, or shall do me the Honour to
declare in my Favour, will further honour me, by supporting
my Endeavours for the Service of the Publick with the Fa-
vour of their Recommendation, in order to banifh out of
our Schools that Absurdity in Praetice which has hitherto
generally prevailed therein. If they please but to interest
themselves in the Bustness, atl Obstrubtions to the Work
aristng from Ignorance or Prejudice‚ or what Motives soever,
will quickly vanifh 3 and we may soon ste such a Revolution
in our Schools as will tend greatly to the Advancement of
Learning and Virtue among us.

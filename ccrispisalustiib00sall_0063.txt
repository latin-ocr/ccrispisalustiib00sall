BELLU M CATILINARIUM

without any provocation so to be.
Catiline confiding in these friends
and accomplices, and because the
number of persons involved in debr
was every where very great, and
because too most of Sylla⁷s old ,[σῖ-Α
diers, having made an end of
what they had gotten, and ref
memhering full well the plunder
they had maele upon S ylla's succeſs,
wished for a civil war ; Catiline.
Isay, putting thest’ several things
together, entered into a de ign of
u urping the government. ‘There
was no army in Italy 3 Cn. Pom-
pey was carrying on a war in the
remotest parts of the earth .· he
himself had great hopes eff obtain-
ing the confielfhip 3 the senate ap·-

peared very ficure3 and all was stlfe ancl quiet 3 which Je-
veral things sterned to present Catiline with a favourahle op-
portunity of carrying his point.

the consulship of L. Caesar and
C. Figulus, he applies himself to
his affociates separately first3 some
he encouraged, others he tried 3 he
acquaints them with his strength,
how little the government was
provided to oppose him, and what
vast advantages they might promise
themselves from the success of
the conspiracy. After he had suf-

ficiently fifted them with relation

to his design, he draws together
such of them as were under the
greatest difficulties, and appeared
the most daring. Upon that occa-

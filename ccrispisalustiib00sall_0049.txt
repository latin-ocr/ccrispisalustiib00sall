BELLUM CATILINARIUM.

aliud alio ferri, neque mu-
tari ac misceri omnia cer-
neres. Nam “ imperium
facile iis artibus retinetur,
quibus initio partum est.
Verum, ubi pro labore
desidia, pro continentia
& aequitate lubido atque
' superbia invasere, fortuna
fimul cum moribus im-
mutatur. Ita imperium
semper ad optumum
quemque ab minus bono
transfertur. Qae homi-
nes arant, navigant, aed 1
fleant, virtuti omnia pa-
rent. Sed multi morta-
les, dediti ventri atque
somno, indoffl, inculti-
que, vitam ficuti peregri-
nantes tranfiere: quibus

and ifflead of moderation and

thus power is ever shifting about
from the '‘⁴²0'st to the better
part of men3 and the advan-

men who nzinded nothing but eat-

polished, have spent their days like
strangers in the world, ‘whose
happiness, contrary to nature, lay
in pampering their bodies, whilst
theirsouls were a burthen to them.
‘The lic e and death of such as

s nce no notice is taken of either.
But he indeed appears to me to
be truly alive, ond to enjoy life,
who is engaged in some us ful

all. Some perhaps may ask, whitil ³
I would have done then ? Tj‘ Ι
which I answer‚ that 1 would hay}
those punished who have betray ’ ,,
the republick to the enemy, y ’Ἰ
not in the way of violence&
force ; which how much soeve',
they may have deserved at your)
hands, yet would be a part uri-jn
worthy of you to ἃᾶ. Νο,’ the}
way I would have you to proceedss
in, is that ofa legal prosecution,

and the evidence ofJugurtha him-
self. Who, if he has surrenderedg
in good earnest‚ will be obedienti
to your order33 but if he ssight-
them‚ you may therebyjudge what
kind of peace and submiffion that
is, by virtue whereof Jugurtha is
to reap impunity sor all his crimes,‘
a few great men immense riches,
and the republick nothing butloss
and disgrace. Unless you are not:
even yet weary of their tyranny,
and those times please you best,

when kingd0m8‚ the provinces,

laws, conns, war ansspeace, and
in {hort> all things whatever, both
divine and human,were at the dis-
posal ofa few-great men : whilst
you the Roman pe0p1e‚ the invin-
cible lords of the world‚were con-
tent with life alone. For which
of you durst refuse the yoke? and
yet, tho' Ι think it highly disho-
nourable for a man to bear ill

     
   

usage with a tame submiffion, I
could be content you should par-
don those wickcd wetcheS, be-
cause they are your fellow-citi-
zeus, if your compafflon to them
would not end in your own de-

struction.

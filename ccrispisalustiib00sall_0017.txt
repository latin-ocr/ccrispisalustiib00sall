A DISSERTATION, &a xiii

and Transsations too of several Authors provided for the Use
of Schools‚ te which no Exception has been taken as ill done,
that ever I could hear 3 yet a great many of our Masters

f ffiould shew so strong an Averfion to what is so manifestly

calculated for their Ease, as well as for the greater Improve-
ment of Youth under their Care. In order to open the Eyes
of such, if poffible, in a Matter, in which both their Interest
and Credit is so highly concerned, I have thought fit to present
them with this Differtation. l shall, therefore, speak distinffly
to the Usefulness of TRANSLATloNs, both Lim-al and Free-
And first of the Lireral.

WHEN Boys set forward in the reading of Latin Authors,
there are but three several Ways sor them to proceed in:
1, By the Help of a Master to construe their Leffons to them ;
2, By the Help of a Dicitionary: Or, 3, By that of Literal
Transsations.

Ι. As to the first, our Schools are very few of them pro-
vided with any more than two Masters3 in which Case it is
impoffible for a Man that has three or four Claffes to take

- Care of, to give that Attendance to them all, in the Way of

construing their Leffons to them, as to keep thern employed
athird Part of the Time they have to spend in the School.
For it is not sufficient for a Master to construe to Boys a
Leffon once over from Beginning to End in a Hurry, (as is
usual, I believe) and so clear his Hands of thern, in Expetstation
that should serve the Turn, by keeping them properly employed,
and he be no more troubled with them for his Affistance upon
that Lesson. Alas! this will fignify just nothing at all. If
he would affist them to any Purpose, he must go over each
Period of a Lesson distinffly and ssowly by itself, more than
once3 and then try the Boys in it one *after another, helping
them out, where he finds them faulter, or at a stand3 and
notadvancing further, 'till the ssowest of them are pretty
perse& in what they are upon. But then, whilst he is thus

if they be not worse employ'd. ssefides‚ this is such a Piece
of Drudgery, as few Masta-s, I believe, will care to undergO.
For where the Use of Transsations is rejeeted, and the
Master’s Lungs are to supply the Want of them, he, in re-
gard to his own Ease, and to save his Breath, is apt to make
very short Work of it, by setting the Boys verv short
Lessons‚ not a third, or not a fourth Part of what they

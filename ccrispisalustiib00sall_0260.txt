in his attempt upon the tower,
return to Cirta3 where being m-

sormed of the arrival of the
ambaffadors, he orders them and

summons ‘.L Βι ll* enus the praetor,
from Utica, and befides him, all-

others of senatorum rank, in or-

Bocchus· 3 the sum¹ Α

other things, acquaint him more ‘

particularly with Salla's kindmst
and concern for him 3 which was
very agreeable. At Ronie, the am-
bafflzdors conf ff ng their king had
been m an error, which he was led
into by the wickedness of jugur-
tha3 and desiring the favour to be
admitted into the Roman alliance,
they received an answer m the fol-
lewing words.

The senate and people of Rome
are ever mind fulof= any kindness or
injury done them3 however, they
pardoned Bocchus' s offence, m
consideration of his repentance3
and should admit him into their
alliance, when he desei-ved it.

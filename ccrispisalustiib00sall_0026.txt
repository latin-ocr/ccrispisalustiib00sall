Transsation, to prepare him for the Work he is upon. If hei?

of his Eye upon the Latin Colunm informs him in what he&

order to remember it against a repeated Perusal of the Paraffss'sl

and assisted in this Way of usmg Transsations‚ as in Conver·⁴{¹
sation; in which Exercise and Affistance given to the Inven-{g
tion lies the whole Advantage of Convefsation for the anain-⁵2²¹
ing of a Language. Nay‚ the Invention is more substanti-²2
ally affisted in the former Case. For the Claffick Authors were·v 1
Men of the most eminent Parts, who writ in their native Lan-{³}
guage, writ at Leisure and upon Deliberation‚ reviewed anelli
correeoed their Works over and over, thereby reducing them?
to such an Accuracy and Exaerness, as no modern Talker off
Latin must pretend to in an Extempore Effufion, or thes}
Swiftness and Hurry of Conversation. So that I think, I need

not scruple to pronounce, that the Way of using Transsations

for the attaining to speak Latin, which Ι here advise, is

even preferable to the best Conversation that is to be had in

that Language. ’

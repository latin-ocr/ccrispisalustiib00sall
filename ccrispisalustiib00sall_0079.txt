reason to expe& every thing he
could wilh for· He requested of,
them, they would not believe, that
he a noblernan, who had himself,
as wellas his ancestors, done many
services for the people of Rome,
should have any occasxon to secl<
the destrufflion of the common-
wealth, whilst M. Tully, who
was but a tenant in town, stood
up for its preservation. As hepro-
ceea'ed in his rzflecstions upon the
consul, there was a general outcry
mi ed against him by the house, as

an enemy to his country, and a parricide. Upon which he,
in a mighty roge, said, Since I find myself circumvented,
and pul-hed upon extremities by my enemies, Iwill put out
the fire of your houses with the utter demolition of them.

XXXIII. With that he got
hastily out of the houfi’, and went
home 3 where considering with him-
ſs’lf, that his defigns upon the con-
sul came to nothing, and that the
city was secured agairfi his inten-
tion of burning it, by watch and
ward constantly kept, he thought
his best course would be to increase
his army, and to make his advan-
tage by seizing of proper places fir
his purpose, before the legions cle-
figned to oppose him were raised.
Accordingly, about midnight he
went offi with a few attendants,
for Manlius's camp. But recom—
mended to Cethegus and Lentulus,
and others, whose zeal and boldnes}
he was afficred of, by all poffible
means to strengthen their party,
to get rid of Cicero as soon as
pofficle, and prepare for a mal]-
sacre, firing of the town, and
other aits of war : that he would
immediately come to the city
with a great armv.

he was not 'rendered either carelejs,
or insolent, by his Jitccejfs 3 but
marched with his army in a square
figure, as if he lqad been in view
of an enemy. Sulla was with the
horse upon the right 3 A. Manlios
with the ſjingers and archers, as
affo some battalions of the Liguri-
ans, on the [ζῇ. In' thevan and
rear he had posted the Tribunos 'of
the army, with several companies
of foot, clear of baggage. Dc-
firters‚ who were but little fit by,
and ‘bolides best acquainted with
the country, were sent out to re-
connoitre the enemy. At the same
time, the consul overlooked every
thing, as if 720 one had been en-
trusted in any share of the command
wtth him. Hawas every where,
commending or reprimaoding such
as destrved it. He was ccrmecl, and
upon his guard himself} and obliged
thesoldicrs 'to be so too. ,Nor did he
usk this great cantion only in his
marth, but in encamffing, posting
the'usual guard of legionary soldi— v
ers at the gates within the camp,
and auxilz‘ary horse without, as also
upon the ramparts ; and going the
rounds to vistt the walch hiaensblf,
not so much from a distrzss of thos&

to make‘ the soldiers more eafiy unda*

Marius both then, and all the tim
he was employed in the war against
Jugurtha, kept up good order in
the army, more hy the din: offhmne,
than punissmzent ; which, many

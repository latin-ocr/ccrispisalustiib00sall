the latter into the Words of the original Latin precisely and,

{whitllJa-nguages go constantly together, joined with continual

Efforts for rendering the one by the other, will make the Idiom .
of the Latin Language almost as familiar to the Mind as that of “

the English. And [shall be bold to say, that this is far beyond
every thing else that can be done, at School however, fo,- the

easy and ready Attainment of a good Latin Stile. But upon .

this Point Ι have enlarged sufficiently above.

III. ANoTHER Use that may be made of Claffick Authors‚ “⁴
so published, is for the easy quick Attainment ofa good English Ῐ
Stile. And the Way thereto is here again for a Person to com- ¹
pare the Original. and Transsation together 'till h'e is able to ren- .
der the Latin Text very readily into the precise Words of the ,

Transsation. What woful Stuff do Boys at School‚ for want of
this Help, usually render the Claffick Authors into, in the con·
struing of their Leffons! By Which we may easily account for
what some have observed, (Mr Locke and the SpeHator, if my
Memory fails me not) that Men educated to LetterS, who
have threshed hard at Latin for nine or ten Years together, are
ostentimes very deficient in their own Language: And no
Wonder. For how should those who have, for so many Years

together at School‚ been so much inured to vile barbarous Lan-1

guage, be able to deliver themselves in much better, with any
great Ease or Readiness. It is Use makes Perfeeinessffn every
thing Mankind have 'occasion to learn in order to pratffise.
And therefore it is not to be expefi'ted that our Youth‚ after
they have run through the Course of a Grammar School‚
should have any Talent at the writing or speaking handsome
English, with any Ease or Fluency, if they have never been
used to any thing of that Kind there, but, instead thereos, have
had the Relish of their Minds vitiated by a perpetual Run. of
improper barbarous Language, or meer Gibberistx. But, in

the Way of proceeding here advised to, the Case is the reverse. ’ ¹

The Invention's being so constantly exercised in Search of pro-

per handsome Language, and withal as constantly affisted in ·

the most substantial Mamer, and presently set a going again,
in case of any Stop or Difficulty‚ must needs render such Lan-

guage very familiar to the Mind, and make it occur, upon all

Occafions of writing or speaking, with great Ease and Readi·
ness. In short, 1 say this Way of using Free and Proper* ζ
Transsations of Claffick Authors is so apparently of the ι’
greatest and most excellent Use for the Purpose of writingg 3

and speaking good English with Ease and Flueney‚ that, in 2

learnt by serving m the wars. Now'
do y ou yourselves judge, whether
ac‘iions or words are of more ac-
count. They despise the meanness
of my descent3 Ι despise their inca-
pacity for business. 1 am upbraid-

their scandalous vices. ‘Tho’ Ι
think the'nature of man to be one⁴
and common to all, but that the'
bravest is‘ the most noble. ’ And
if now the fathers of Albinus‚‘

whether they would rather 'have'
chosen me for their descendant, οι*

they would make, but that they
should have defired the most deser-
ving men might have been their
sons ? But if they have reason to
despise me, let them do the same
by their ancestorS, whose nobilsty,
like mine, took its rise from their
noble behaviour. They envy my
mdvancement · let them then envy
my ac‘livity , my integrity‚ and.
dangers too; because it was b'y

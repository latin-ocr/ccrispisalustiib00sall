drooped into our hands to no pur-
pose. Nor would I for certainties
pursue uncertainties‚ by the help of
sorry fellows not to be depended

upon. ButasI have‚upon many im—

portant occasions, found you gal-
lant and faithful to me, I have
thereby been encouraged to engage
in the greatest and most glorious
undertakingthat everwa8,and the
rather, because Ι am senfible our

interests are the very same. For Car&

union of interest is the only last· Vfcju‘m

ing bond of friendship. But you
have already each of you heard
apart what it is 1 propose to go
upon. And Ι am daily more hearti-
ly disposed thereto, when I confi-
der what sort oflife we must lead,
if we do not endeavour the reco-
very of our liberty. For since all
power and authority has been en-
grossed by a few great rnen, kings
and tetrarchs have been tributary
to them ; to them only have the
several nations and provinces of
the empire paid taxes. The rest
of us, however brave and honest,
whether noble or ignoble, have
been treated' as rnob only, with-
out interest or authority, in a ssa-
viih subjeffion to those to whom
we ihould be a terror, if the go-
vernment was upon a right foot.
Now all interest, power, honour,
and siches, are with them, or
where they please. They have
left us nothing but dangers, dis-
honour, impeachments‚ and want.
And how long, my most gallant
frIends‚ will you take all this at
their hands? Is it not better to
die bravely, than to lose a mi-
serable dishonourable life in a dis-

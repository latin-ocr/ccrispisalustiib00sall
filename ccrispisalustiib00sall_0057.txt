Romans, fortune began to shew
her malice, and confound all. For
they who had endured fatzgues,
dangers, and the most severe
trials, with ease, found peace and
plenty, defirable things with the
Sssistrstfflssz οῗ msszejf‘zzffltss
of power, grew upon them, and
proved the occ-afion of all manner
of mischief. For avarice was the

destruction of saith, honesty, and
other good qualities3 and in the

room thereos brought in fafhion,
pride, cruelty, profaneness, and a
mercenary spirit. Ambition obliged
many to breach of saith, and to
have one thing in their hearts,
and another upon their tongue53
to contrat? or break friendship, not
as honour, but their interest re-
quired 3 and to seem good, rather
than be really so. These vices
grew up but slowly for some time,
and were now and then punifhed.
But the infletion at last carrying
all before it like the plagae, the

quast pestilentia, invafit3 state was hugely altered, and the

civitas immutata, impe-
rium, ex justiffimo atque
optumo, crudele intole—
randumque factum.

ambitio, quam avaritia,

bat: quod tamen vitium
propius virtuti erat. Nam
gloriam, honorem, im-
perium, bonus, ignavus,
aeque fibi exoptant. Sed
‚ine vera via nititur: huic
qula bonae artes desunt,
dolis atque fallaciis con-
tendit. Avaritia pecuniae

government, from being the most
jzgst, and the best thot ever was,
became cruel and intolerable.

XI. But ot fi'st ambition more
than avarice influenced the minds
of the Romans .· which vice, how·
ever, had some resemblance of a
virtue. For the hrave, and the
bost-spirited, are equally fond of ·
glory‚ honour, and power. But
the former pursues them in the
right way ; whereas the latter, as
destitute of all good qualities, en-
deavours to come at them in the
way of trick and deecit. Avarice

BELLUM JUGURTHINUM.

Marius, for he commanded in thot
quarter, he designedly stackened
his speed, under pretence of being
disheartened, Jufflring the Numi-
dions to look on and see the engage-
mentos the king. Eut then,whilll
they were very intent upon the
fight, he suddenly renews the as-
sault upon the wall with the ut-
most violence. And now some os
the fildi ers were advancecl upon
ladders nign the top of it, when
the townstnen,flocking to tae place,
pour upon them stanes, stre, and
all manner of weapons befide. Our
men at first stood stffly to it ; but
some of them tumbling headlong to
the Ground, upon the breaking of
a ladder or two they were upon,
the rest shz'fted for themselves, as
well as they could, a great many
of them being ſsadly mauled, and
fiw without wouua's. At Icfi night

in those cities which hod revolted
from him, ond were saffict'ently
strong by nature or art. Eut his ar-

the province where it borders up—
on Numidia. Yet he did not, ac·
cording to the custom of others,
spond the time in idleneſs and lux-
ztry3 but, fince lae hod hut sinall

ftlves to loy a παρ for Jugurtlm,

camp not sar from Cirta, he waz‘ts
sor the kings‚ thinking it not pro·
per to engage with the Moors, an
enemy he was not yet acquainted
with, but upon fhme advantage.
In the mean time, he had notice
by letters from Rome that the
province of Numidia was affigntzd
to Marius. For he had heard be·'
fore that he was made consul⁷
With which things he was prodi-
gioussy affected, to a degree incon-
sssent'with all equity and decency,
insomuch that he could neither re-
frain from team, or govern his
tangue 3 and, tho' he was an extra-
ordinary person in other respeb't’s,
yet under trouble of mind he was
too impatient‚ which some imputed
to his pride, others'to a just re-
sentment of the contumelious usage
he had, many to a concern that
the victory he had got should be
Jnatched out of his hands. But it
appears pretty plain to me that he
was more disturbed at the advance-
ment of Marius than the injury
a’one to hmfilf, and would not
have borne it so beavily if the pro-
vince that was taken from him had
been given to any body effe but
Marius.

LXXXV. IVherefore, as well
upon account of this refintment, as
because it seemed a solly to take care
eff another man’s bafinesi, at his
own hazard, he dispatches mffn-
gers to Bocchus, to defire he would
not become an enemy to the RQ-
man people without any occasion
given for it. That he had now a
fine opportunity of entering into
the Roman alhance, which would
be muchbetter for him than awar.

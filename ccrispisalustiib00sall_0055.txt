Glory they could never have too
much os, but for riches a hands'ome
competency sufficed them. And

here I could entertain the reader
with numerous irfiances of mighty
armies defiated by inconstdcrable
numbers, and cit-ies wonderfully

fortified by nature taken by them.
But that would detain- me too long

a mightysway in all things 3 r'alses
or depreffes them at pleasure‚ ra-
ther than according to truth. The
aniam of the Athenians were, in
my opinion, great and glorious
enough, but not altogether so con-
fiderable as fame represents them.
But because that city produced
great plenty of fine authors, the
exploits of that people are through-
out the world celebrated fir the
greatest ,that ever were perfirm-
ed by men. Accordingly the cou-
rage and conduc? of the aa't‘ors
have been as much magnified as
it was in the power of the finest
wits to do it. But this was an
advantage the Roman people never
had, because the wisest men were
always the most engaged in the ser-
w‘ce of the state ; for none pursued
the improvement of the mind only,
without regard to that of the body.
‘The best men chose rather the part
of aeving than speaking 3 and to
have their own 'atcht‘evements cele-
brated by others, rather than write

those os others themselves.

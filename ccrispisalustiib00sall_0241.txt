den, with water only. Then, at the
time appointed, he draws out of
the camp, and marching all night,
encamped again. ‘The same he did
the next night ,τους and in the
third, he arrived α >little before day
at a hill, not ,above two miles
from Capsa ςι and there hestays, as
privately as pqffible, with all his ar-
my. But as soon as day appeared,
and the Numidiam, as being un-
der no apprehenfions at all of an
enemy, many of them came out of
the town: on a sudden he orders
all his horse, and with vthem the
nimblest qf the foot‚ to make di-
reffllyjor Capsa with all speed, and
secure the, gates. At the same time
he follows them with all diligence
and expedition, and suffirs not ,the
soldiers to plunder. then ,the
towns-people found„ this, they were
in the utmost confuston and fright‚
withso unexpec‘ied a calamityg and
as part of their people were witb-
σω the wall, in the, hands o] the
enemy, they found it neccffiry to
surrender. Yet notwithstanding,
the town was burnt, the Numidi-
ans of age put to, the savard, ,all
the rest sold, and the plunder of
the placegiven to the soldiers. This,
piece of execution, contrary to the
rules ofwar, was noi· occasioned
by the avarice or cruelty of the Con-
sul, but¹ from a confideration that
the place was very advantageous
for Jugurtha, and dffcult vsor us
to come iat 3 the peoplo too, being
fickle and faithleſs, ,αηά by no

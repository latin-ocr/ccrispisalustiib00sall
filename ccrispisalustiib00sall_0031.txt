A DISSERTATION, &c. xxvii

„low them3 keep so many of our M asters up to old Forum, the
Youthrof the Kingdom suffer miserably by it iu their Educa-
tion. And therefore it were further to be wished, that Gentle-
men who are convinced of the Reasonableness of what Ι have
been pleading' for, would be pleased to add the &Veight of their
Authority to my poor Endeavours, and discountenance‚ by
t‘heir Resentment‚ the Praffiice of such Absurdity upon their

’ Sons, as still generally prevails in the Education of Youth in
Grammar—Schools. AllI shall add is, that-‘such Gentlemen

· as like the Sentiments delivered in this Dissertation, may, Ι

» humbly presume to hope, find many more equally agreeable to
them, upon all the Branches of Education‚ in my Efflzy upon
the Subje&‚ as likewise upon all the Branches of Literature, in
aBook I publifhed some Time ago, under the Title of, An
Eſjizy upon Study‚ wherein Direfflions arje given for the due Con-
dua} thereos, and the Collefflion of a Library proper for the Pur-
pose‚ conststing of the choiast Books in all the stveral Parts of

’ Learnmg.

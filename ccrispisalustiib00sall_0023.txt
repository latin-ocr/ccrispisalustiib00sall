ADISSERTATION,&c. xix

most important Affairs of Life without consulting* their Rea-
‘fon at all. Very few have the noble Freedom of Mind to
examine Things striffly and impartimur, in order to make the
Result of such Examination the Rule of their Condud't. The
Generality chuse to save themselves that T rouble, by going
with the Herd‚ qua itur, non qua eundum ss, as a great Man
among the Antients words himself upon Occafion of making
the same Remark, if my Memory fails me not.

s As for the Hebrew Tongue, to facilitate the Learning of that,
Arias Montanus long since published the Hebrew Bible with an
interlineary Verfion‚ for which, I doubt not, such as apply
themselves to the Study of the Hebrew Language‚ are thankful
to his Memory ‚ at least they have a good deal of Reason, Iam
sure; having received myself a great deal of Benefit from the
Use os it in learning that Language. And Mr. Locke was so sen-
sible of the vast Help to be had from Literal Transsations‚ that
he did not think it below him to publish AEsop's Fables in the
same F orm as Montanus did the Hebrew Bible, with an inter-‘
lineary Verfion. I grant indeed that Way of publishing Au—
thors with the, Transsation so intermixed with the Original‚ is

not proper for Schools. But however, what those two Gentle- ⁸

men did in that Way, ih'ews sufficiently their Opinion of the
Usefulness of Literal Transsations. And the latter, Mr. Lock'e‚
thought so well of thern, that he declares in his Book of Edu-
cation5 Mothers may by the Help of them teach their Sons the
Latin Tongue themselves, if they please. IVhatever Sur, says
he, there is made about getting of Latin, his (a young Gen—
tleman’s) Mother may teach it him herjbff, if fhe will but
spend two or three Hours in a Day with him, ancl make him
read the Evangelf'sts in Latin to her. For fhe need but buy a
Latin ‘Testament‚ and having got somebody to mark the lcss
Syllable but one, in Words of above two Syllables (which is
enough to regulate her Pronuncintion) read doily in the GoJL
pels‚ and then let her avoid understanding them in Latin, if
fhe con. And when fhe understands the Evangelists in Latin, let
her in the some Manner read AEsop’s Fames, and so proceed on
to Eutropius, Justin, and other such Books. I do not mention
this as an Imagination of what I fancy may do, but us of a Thing
{Vhave known done, and the Latin ‘Tongue with Ense got this
ay.

To conclude, the Use of Literal ‘’Transsations has no Dif-
ficulty in it, employs nothing but Memory. The Boys have
proper Words all ready at hand, without the tedious and often-
times fruitless Labour of hunting and poring in a Diffionary, or

that

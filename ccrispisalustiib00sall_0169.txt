nucius Rufus, persuades him, fince
he was descended from Mastnssa,
to aggravate the odiousnefs qs Ju-
gurtha’s crimes, and alarm him
with fears, bys making his suit to
the senate for the kingdom of Nu-
midia. The consul being vastly
dcfirous of having the war conti-
nued under his command, was for
kindlingr a new flame rather than
have *the old one die away. He
had got by lot the province of Nu-
midia, Minucius Macedonia. W hen ‚

in ach sert of work watches all
his metiens and neurus, and when
the matter seemed ripe for it, lays
his plat. One of the rogues enga-
ged in the defign‚ falls upon filas-
ssva, and kills him, but in so un-
guarded a manner that he was im-
mediately apprehended3 and be>-
ing urged by many, and especially
Albinus the constal, to consess who
set him on work, he did so. Bo-
milcar was prosecuted upon it, more

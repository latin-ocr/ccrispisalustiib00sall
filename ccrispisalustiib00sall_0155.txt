derly nobkmen, that hod run
through the great ffces ‚of state,
are dispatched over mto Africa 3
among whom was M. Scaurus
mentioned above, a consulor gen-
thmon, and then at the head of the
senate. These gentlemen, as there
was a general outcry agairgst Ju-
gurtha's behaviour, and the Nu-
midiam vehemently preſjed them
sor despatch, went aboard a skip in
three doys' time, and arriving soon
oster at Utica, smel α letter to
Jugztrtha, with orders to repair
fortthizh to them in the pro-
vince, for that they had a meffage
to him from the senate. Upon
finding that persons of high rank.
(md of very great sway at Rome,
as he had been iry‘ormed, were come
to oppoje his defigam, he was much
fhocked, 'and distrofied betwixt
sear and α pa ’ionote defire to carry
his point against Atherbal. He
feared the senate’s resentmcnt, if
he did not obcy the commffoner53
and then again, his mind, blindai

prz'ze. The worse of the two things
proposed to his choice at lest

W herefhre, drawing his army quite
round the place, he uses · his zetmost
efforts to break into Cirt613 being
in great hopes that, by thus di·
viding the force of the enemy, he
nght hit upon some lucky chance
forfitcceſs, either hy force or cun-
ning. But, mistarrying in his de-
stgn of getting Atherbal into his
hands before he attended the com·
mzffioners, for sear of provolcing
Scaurus, whom he much dreoded,

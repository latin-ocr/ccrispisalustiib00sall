sceleris, non prius omifit

Igitur, quamquam in
priore afflone ex amicis
quinquaginta vades dede-
rat, regno magis quam
vadibus consulens, clam
in Numidiam Bomilca-
rem dimittit3 veritus, ne
reliquos popularis metus

he perceived the odium of the thing!

therefore, though in the fi'st aetion
he had given fifty of his friends«
as bail for Bomilcar’s appearance&
yet being more concernedfor the praa}
servation of his kingdom thaux
his bail, he sends him qffprivatelffl
into Numidia, fearing lest the rest
os his subjebi's should be cffraid of
obeying him, if he fhould be pu-

he went away himself, being or-
dered hy the senate to depart out o)
Italy, It is reported of him, tha&
after he was got out of Rome, Vh
frequently looked back' without say-

out into these words, that the city
was to be sold, and would soon
be ruined, if it did but meet with
a chapman.

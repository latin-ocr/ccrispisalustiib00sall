BELLUM CATILINARIUM.

Sed ei cariora semper om·

other articles (ff luxury she was-
very nice ana' dexterous. But for
decency and modesty, those were
the least of her care. It was hard
to say, whether she was more la-
vifh of her money, or her reputa-
tion. She was a woman of thot
furious lust, that she more fre-
quently made aclvances to the men
than they to her. She had fre·
quently, contrary to her promise
given, revealed secrets, abjured
what hod been lest m 1⁷21st with
her, hod been guilty of murder, and,
at the irssigation os luxury and po-
verty together, had run headlong
into all manner cf wickedness. But
she was α woman of parts, could
write verses, was very socetious,

ond equally fitted for modest or wanton conversation. In fhort,
she was an exceeding pleasant witty woman.

XXVII. His rebus

comparatis, Catilina ni-
hilominus in proxumum
annum consulatum pete-
bat3 sperans, fi defigna-
tus foret, facile se ex
voluntate Antonio usu-
rum. Neque interea qui-
etus erat, sed omnibus
modis infidias parabat Ci-
ceroni. Neque illi tamen
ad cavendum dolus aut
astutiae deerant. Namque
a principio consulatus sui,
multa per Fulviam pol-
licendo effecerat, ut
Curius, de quo paullo ante
memoravi, conflua Cati·
linae fibiaeproderet. Ad
uhoc, collegam suum An
tonium pafflone provin-
ciae perpulerat, ne contra
nempublicam sentiret :

x XXVII. But notwithstanding
these preparations sor the execu-
tion of his projebi, Catiline de-
clared ha mself a candidate for the
consulship agairss the next year;

in hopes, is he stmuld be chosen, of
making Anthony his tool. In the
mean time he was not idle, but
used his utmost endeavours to take
off Cicero, who wanted not cun-
ning and dexterity on his part to
countermine all his contrivances.
For, os fhon as he entered upon the
office of consul, by large promises
to Fulvia, he prevailed with ⁴Qum-

(2ι tus Curius, whom I hove men-

tioned α little above, to discover
to him all the defigns of Catilinc.
And further, hy the affierance of
a province, he engaged Anthony,
not to ab? agoirfi the govern-
ment3 ond had privately guards
of friends and clients about him.

pleasant to them 3 which Transsations certainly do: And theress ’ · 5
fore are a vifible Means, not to make them idle, but industrious} ’ ξ
Whereas in the vulgar Method of our Schools, Boys find it im· '¹ l
prae'ticable to do their Bufiness to Content, and so are ostentimes* l
rendered desperately idle, as being convinced by frequent and 3
woful Experience, that no Pains‚ no Industry they can dfe, will ¹
avail to secure them effectually from the Lash. ’ J
THESE Objeffions against the Use of Transsations have .
not, however, hindered ,but that Transsations have 'been 2
thought so necessary for the easy and speedy Attainment of the
Greek Tongue, that, for above these hundred and fifty Years
last past, no Authors in that Language have been publiihed ’
without them. This might, one would think, have naturall
led the World to the Pursuit of the same Meth0d‚ at least Wit
the eafier Authors of the Latin Tongue, for the Use of Schools. Α
For must it not needs appear to any considerate Man a little
unaccountable, that Transsations should be thought useful and
necessary for Men or elder Boys, in order to >their more easy and
speed y Progress in the Greek Tongue, but neither neceffary nor
useful for younger Boys in the Attainment of the Latin? Is
it agreeable to Reason or common Sense, to suppose a Boy of x
sixteen or seventeen Years of Age stands in need of a Transsa*
tion, to affist him in reading of Greek, but that a Boy of ten
or twelve may do his Busmess in the Latin Tongue eafily and
expeditioussy enough without any such Help ? Has a Child of
that Age more Sense for the consulting and using a Latin Dic-
tionary, than he has for making Use of a Greek Lexicon when
heis arrived almost at the Years of Manhood? And what sorry
'Work would Boys make of it, if, upon entering the Greek
Testament, they should be denied the Use of a Latin Testa-
ment, to help them in getting their Leffons‚ and be obliged to ¹.
piel< the Meaning of their Words out of a Lexicon ? Every
body can see the Absurdity of such a Manner. of proceeding in
this lnstance, and would be forward enough to cry out against x
any Master that should be guilty of it. And yet the like Absur- *
dity committed in the Teaching of the Latin Tongue goes glib-
ly down, and pass'es for the most proper VVay of Proceeding.
Now what is it that disposes Men to make so wide a Difference, ἰ
where there is none at all in the Nature of Things? Nothing
but Custom, the great Rule that most Men usually go by in tbi} ,33

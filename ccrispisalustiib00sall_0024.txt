Loss of Time, and with a great deal of Satisfaffion to find >i

believe few Men of Sense, that will but duly consider what has
been said above, will gainsay‚ That a Boy by the Help of Li· ’
teral Transsations would make a better Progress in the Language η,
in one Year, than without them he could do in three or four.
Non are Literal Transsations of Latin Authors Xuseful only s
for the lower Forms of a School, but likewise for the higher, ἠ
or such as can read them pretty well, without any such Help, ῥ’
as well to bring them to a more complete Aequaint‘ance with vs
them, in the most expeditious Manner, as likewise to a Readvi- ‘³
ness in the writing and speaking of proper Latin, by reading the 's
Transsation into the original Latin of the Author. Constant
conversation in Latin, with such as talk it well, would indeed 2
be of great Use for that Purpose. But then very little can be ²
done in that Way at School. For to confine Boys to the
talking of Latin amongst themselves, before they have attained ,
any tolerable Skill in the Language, is absurd, and a Means to*
prevent their ever'speaking or writing it well. If Boys> are to
be so confined‚ they ought to be constantly attended by a good-
Master, to help them out upon all Occafions, by furnilhing
them with proper Languager But this is manifestly impraEli-
cable, where there are but two Masters in a School, or, as is
ostentimes the Case, but one. A ready and proper Use of the
Latin Tongue is a Matter of very great Difficulty, and never
to be attained by Boys talking barbaroussy amongst themselves 3
if it is at all attainable at School. For my Part, Inever yet
knew so much as one Instance of its being attained· there, 'in any Y
School that has come within the Reach of my Observation, or
indeed any thing like it. Nay Ι have talked with very inge-
nious Men, of uncommon Learning, and besldes Persons of
confiderable Experience in that Way, who looked upon the
bringing Boys at School to any thing of a true and genuine La-
tin Stile wholly imprafflcable. Now, tho' I will not affirm ⁴
this, yet I must be allowed to say, it is a Matter of very great
Difficulty, insomuch that I greatly question, whether any Me-
thod that can be taken with them will be found generally suc-
cessful, in any reasonable Time, belides thisI here recommend-

ficulty is still behind, as every one must be sensible that knows
much of the Latin Tongue. A ready Use of proper Terms,

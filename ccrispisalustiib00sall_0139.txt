Eut when Africa
was dehvered from that pestilent
people, we enjc ved ali the delights
of peace, as having n o enemy, un-
less such as you had apt ointed us.

When behold, ux 1expcc’cedly, Ju-
gurtha ereffling his plumesthh m—
tolerable impudence, wickminess,
and pride, and murdering my bro—
ther, his near relation, made his
kingdom the first prize of his vil-
lainy 3 and then, not finding it
praffiicable to take me off by the
like wicked contrivance‚ whilst I
expe&ed nothing at all of violence
or war, has, in the face of your
mio-hty power, driven me as you.

family to do, it did, that is, it
affisted you in all your Wars: it
isin your power to make us a
return of peace and security,⁴
mighty fathers, My father left«
behind him us two brothers, and
thought he should make jugurtha
a third brother to us by the fa-
vours he heaped upon him. One
of the three is a1ready murdered,
and [had much ado to escape the
wicked hands of the other. What
{hall I do? Or whither shall Ι,
unhappy man, apply my sels? Al}

A DISSERT'ATION, &cs xxi

and of proper Phrases, or F orms of Expreffion, upon allOcca-
fions, seems hardly attainable in any reasonable Time, or the
longest Term of the Continuance of Boys at Grammar-
Schools', but in the Method Ipropose. This, 1 say, will be
the most ready, expeditious Method that can be taken, at
School however, to furnish the Mind with a Plenty of Words,
and a Variety of Phrases and Expreffions for the same Sense,
and that without any Danger of Error, which the Use of Dic-
tionaries and Phrase-Books would be attended with. For none
indeed can receive any great Benefit from them for that Pur-
pose, but such as are good Judges in the Latin Tongue, and
well acquainted with the Idiom thereos already.

LITERAL TRANsLATmNs Boys are to begin with3 and
after they have gone through four or five Authors, in the Me-
thod of reading such Transsations into the very original Latin
of the Authors, they are to be advanced to Free and Elegant
Yrmgslations. Two or three of the finest Claflick Historians,
with Terence, and some of the Epistles, and other Pie-ces of
Tully, published with such Transsations, would, in Conjunc-
tion with the Claffick Historians I have already publissred with
Literal TranssationS, be sufficient for the purpose of attaining
a ready Use of a good Latin Style, perhaps equal to Conver-
sation itself, if not preferable to it, at least in one Respee‘t
more advantageous, by furnifhing the 7]er with better Latin
¹for his English, as oft as he wants it, than any, even the
1 greatest Masters of the Latin Tongue, could help him to, in
the Way of Conversation. For the >great Advantage of con-
stant conversation for the Attainment of any Language, lies
in the perpetual Exercife of the Invention, in what a Man
says himself, and the like perpetual Affistance given to his ln-
yvention, in the constant Suggestion of proper Language by
those he converses with. Now both these Advantages are to be ’
had from the Method of Proceeding here advised, and the
latter of· them to a greater Degree of perfeetion, than can be
had in the Way of Conversition. For in converfing to attain
the Use of a Language, the Learner employs his InventIOn to
express his Thoughts properly 3 he hunts and casts about conti-
nually for Words and Phrases that may suit his Defign. If he
delivers himself improperly, or sticks and stammers for want of
Language, those he conver-ses with corre& his Improprieties,
and help him to what is proper, which he carefully atterids to,
and repeats it, may be, two or three Times to himself, to make
it stick by him, against another Occafion. Just so too in
attempting to read a Transsation into Latin, the {ieamer

sently after them C. Marius, with

some auxiliary battalions ; and with

tears begs ‘ff him by their friend-
skip, and the eommonweahh, that

fix upon the honour of their vic-
torious army, or the enemy to get
off unrevenged. He prefintly exe-
cutes his orders. But Jugurtha,

affigns to some tribzme53 aed then
he himſs’lsadvances up to the town,
and makes an affiult upon the wall,
as he had done the day before. In
the mean time, Jugurtha from his
cover comes suddenly upon our men.

ans have been able to have stood it
any long time, had not their fon,
mixing with the horse, done great
execution in the battle. Upon

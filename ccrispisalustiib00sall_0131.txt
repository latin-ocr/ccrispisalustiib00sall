Ι BELLUM JUGURTHINUM.

En habes virum dignum

quae fama acceperat, ex
litteris imperatoris ita effe
cognovit, cum virtute,
tum gratia viri permotuS,
flexit animum suum3
ὅτ, Jugurtharn beneficiis
vincere aggressus est. Sta-
timque eum adoptavit, δι
testamento pariter cum
filiis haeredem instituit.
Sed ipse, paucos post an-
1108, morbo atque aetate
confe&us, cum fibi finem
vitae adesse intelligeret,
coram amicis δε cognatis,
itemque Atherbale δε Hi-
empsale filiis, dicitur hu-
juscemodi verba cum Ju-

gurtha habuiffe.

X. Parvum ego te,
Jugurtha, amiſjo patre,
fine spe, fine opibus, in
meum regnum accepi3
existumans non minus me
tibi, quam fi genuiſjem,
ob beneficia carum fore.
Mque ea res falsum me

gard to the friendship betwixt υς,
l congratulate you upon this oc-
casion. Herewith I return you a
man, worthy of you, and his
grandfather Mafiniss'a. The king,
finding what common fame had be-
fore itfisrmcd him of confirmed by
this letter of the general, moved
as well by the fine accomplifhments
eff the man, as his interest with
the Romans, resolvecl to be easy
with him, and endeavour to con-
quer him by kindness. Accordingly
he immediately adopted him, and
by a will made him joint-heir with
hissbns. In a few years after,
being worn out with infirmities
and old age together, and finding
himself a dying man, he is said,
in the presence of his friends ancl
relations, his two sons Atherbal
and Hiempsal too being by, to have
addreffed ⁵¹himself to Jugurtha in
the Worels following .·

Χ. Ι did, my dear Jugurtha,
receive you into my court, left a
little one by your father, without
hopes or fortune, promising my-
self that you would be mindful of
the favour, and love me no less
than my own children, if I lnould
have any ; nor was Ι deceived in
that matter. For, to say nothing
ofother great and noble aetions of
yours, at your return from Nu-
mantia, you did me and my king-
dom the utmost honour, by your
excellent behaviour improved to
the highest pitch the friendship
that before subfisted between the
Romans and us 3 and revived
afreffl the name of our family in
Spain3 and finally, what is the
most difficult thing in the world,

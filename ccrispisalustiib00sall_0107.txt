BELLUM CArILINARmM. 103

ita βε mores habent, lihe-
rales ex fitiorum fhrlu-
nis. Sint mifiricordes in
furibus ararii. Ne illis
sanguinem nostrum largis
antur 3 ἅθ’, dum pauczs
sceleratis parcunt, bonos
onmis perditum eant. Be-
m ἔθ’ cemposite C. Caesar
paullo ante in hoc ordine
de vita {9⁵ morte dffru-
it, credo saffo existumans
ea, quae de in eris memo-
rantur3 diverso itinere
malos α bonis loca toetra,
inculta, foeda atque sor—
midolofiz habere. Itaque
censuit, ‘pecunias eorum
bublicandas, ipfhs per mu-
aicipia vin czgstodiis habena
r*1053 videlicet, ne, fi Ro-
maestnt, aut a popularibus
cory'urationis, aut a multi-
tudine condud'm, per vim
eripiantur. Quast vero
mali atque scelesti tan-
tummodo in urbe δ’ non
ber totam Italiam stnt3
aut non ibi plus poſjit
audacia, ubi ad defenden-
dum opes minores sunt.
Quare vanum equidem
lboc confilium qst, st peri-
¹sculum ex illis metuit.- Sin
in tanto omnium metu
folus non timet3 eo magis

rafim, me mihi atque vobis
umere.

LVI. Quarr cum de
P. Lentulo caetertsque
statffetis, pro certo habe-
tote, vos fimul de exer-
citu Catium, ἔθ’ de om-

wihus conjuratis decerne-

destruti'tion. Let them, fince it
is now become the falhion of the
times, be generous out of thetfor-
tunes of our allies‚ Let them ffiew
compaffion to the robbers of the
publick 3 butlet them not pretend
to make a present of our blood to
thern, and by sparing a few vil-
lains bring destru&ion upon all
good people. C. Caesar spoke
just now very handsomely and
prettily of life and death, as judg-
ing, I presume, the vulgar notions
of hell, where the bad are divided
from the good, and confined ιιι
nasty, uncomfortable, filthy, dis-
mal places, to be false3 and there—n
fore abvised to confiscate their
estates, and keep their persons un-
der confinement in the boroughs ;
from an apprehension, I suppose,
if they should be kept at Rome,
of their being rescued, either by
their feIIows, or a hired mob. As
if we had rascals and villains only
in town, and not all Italy over ;
or as if bold attempts would not
be more likely to succeed, where
there was the least ability to op-
pose them. This therefore Is very
idle advice, if he fears any dan—
ger from them; but if he alone
is not afraid, whilst every body
else is, I am the more obliged to
be afraid both sor myself and
you. >

LVI. Wherefore‚ in judging
the case of Lentulus, you may
depend upon it, you.determine
that of Catiline’s army, ¹'and the
rest of the conspirators, at the
same time. The more vigour you

re.

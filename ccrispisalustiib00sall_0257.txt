rather to be at' peace, than war
with us; and no longer disparage
yourself, a most excellent person,
by uniting with the worst man a-
live, Jugurtha ; and at the same
time deliver us from the odious ne-
ceffity of· pursuing you, gussty only
of a mistake, and that most vile
wretch, with thelike ven geance. It
has ever been a maxim with the
Roman people, fince theIr first rise
in the world, which was but low,-
to procure themselves friends, ra-
ther than ssaves3 and they have al·
ways thought it safer to rule over
willing subjeots, than by compulsi-
on. No alliance can be more com-
modious for you than ours. In the
first place, because we are a great
way 0ff3 in which case, there can ⁷
be very small occafion of diffe-
rence, and yet there may be the
same good understanding as if we
were near neighbours; and in the
next place, because we have sub·
jeE’c's enough3 but neither we, nor
any one else, had ever friends e*-
nough. And I could have wished,
you had taken this course at first!
Youwould certainly, bythis time,
have received more good at the
hands of the Roman peopk, than
you have nowsuffered evil. Butas
the concerns of mankind are, in
the main, subje&ed to the power ,
of fortune, who had a mind, it
seems, that you should as well feel
the effesaes or our force, as of our
favour 3 now that {he puts the
latter in your power, be quick,
and go on, as you have began.
Now you have great advantages
for correfiing your former mis·
takes, by future’services. Finally,

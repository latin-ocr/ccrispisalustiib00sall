LXXXIII. therefire the two ’
armies meet in a place appointed ,
by the kings 3 where, after they ,ἴ ¹
had pledged their saith to one ἶ
another, Jugurtha fired the stul of ’ἵ
Bocchus, by talking to the follow- ,
ing ffe? ; That the Romans were ’-
an unjust people‚o'f insatiable ava- ¹

mankind. They had just as much
cause of war with Bocchus, as x
with himself and othei· nations, ἦ
the lust of dominion, for the sake
of which they looked upon an ,

was; not long before the carthae
ginians, and king Perses, bad been
their enemiw, and so would every
prince hereafter be, especially -of
considerable power and strength.
After he had said this, and other
things to the like purpose, they re-

the haste he could, to break the peace
betwixt Bocchus and the Romans,

change his mind.

’ BELLUM CATILINARIUM

XXXVII. Hestaidajew days
with C. Flamznius in the territory
of Reate, 'till he could provide the
neighbourhood, which had been en-
goged in the cause before, with
arms, and then marched with the
fasces, and other enstgns of com-
mand, to Manlius’ s camp. W hen
the news of this was carried to
Rome, the senate voted Catiline and
Manlius enemies, and fixed a day
for the troops under their com-
mand, within which, if they laid
down their arms, they were as·
sured of a pardvon, >except such as
had been condemned for cap itai]
crimeS. They likewise ordered the
consuls to levy an ar my, which
C. Antonius was to lead with ali
expedition against Cafline, whilst
Cicero was to provide <for the se-
curity of the 'city. The Roman
state at that time seemed to me to
be in a mostpiteous condition; when,
though ull natiofls from the Ylstng
of the sun to the setting os the
same were reduced to their obe-
dIence, and there was at homea
profouncl peace, and a prodigiam
cgstuence of riches, which men are
apt to prefer chbre every thing
else 3 yet was there a sort of peo-
ple, and Romans too, who were ob-
stinately bent upon their own ruin,
with that of the commonwealth.
For, notwitlfianding the twovotes
above mentioned, there was not one
osso great a number concerned in
the plot that was prevailed upon by
the reward ffred to make the [eall
discovery, nor one defirtedCatiline' s
camp. So strangely were their
minds infeHed with a dispofttion to

rebellion and misthief.

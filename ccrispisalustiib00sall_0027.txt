at School. F ew grown People will ever have the Patience to
hammer out such a Language as the Latin, b'y the Help of a
Distionary. That would require more Time than any one in
a 'thousand can or will spare. But in this Way of Proceeding,
the regainfflg, or improving in the Latin Tongue, will ‘out be
a new Kind of Diverfi0n‚ which the World has hitherto been
unacquainted with. The Time Gentlemen need to employ
that Way, is less than those who are the most taken up with
Bufiness, usually spend upon their Pleasures.

I PRocEED now to treat of Free and Proper Translations,
wherein a large Liberty is taken of departing from the Letter of
the Latin, in order to make the most handsome proper English.
Now the great Usefulness of Claffick Authors‚ published with
such Transsations, is so very apparent, that I wonder no body
has attempted any thing of this Kind before me. English
Transsations indeed of many of them have been published by
themselves, as being defigned, I suppose, purely for the Use
of such as are ignorant of the Latin Tongue, by presenting
¹ them, for their Information or Amusement, with that in Eng-
lish, which they could not come at in the Original‚ without
³ any further View or Intention at all. But then such Transsa-
tions may be of the greatest Use for other important Purposes,
upon account of which it is highly convenient* to have thern
ς published along with the Originals. As,
¹ Ι. CLAssch Authors, so published, will be vastly serviceable
for the easy and speedy Improvement of such aS, having no
great Aequaintance with the Latin Tongue, are defirous of

wherein a good deal of Fryeedom is taken of departing from the
Letter or Words of the Original, are at all for the Purpose of
such as have but little or no Knowledge of the Latin Tongoe,
to begin with in order to their learning of that Language. No.
Such ought, in the first Place, to make Use of Literal Transsa-
tions, ’till they have got a pretty general Aequaintance with
Words3 after which they may proceed to such as are F ree and
Proper, by the Help whereof they will read an Author substan-
tially over in a fourth Part of the Time they could do without,
to speak within Compass.

ΙΙ. THE publishing of Claffick Authors, with proper and
kandsome Transsations, will be very convenient for those that
are defirous to attain a Faculty of writing and speassk ug Latin
with Propriety and Readiness. The Way will be tr “ead the
Original a'nd Transsation together, 'till they can read ,ν ῖεηάζι·

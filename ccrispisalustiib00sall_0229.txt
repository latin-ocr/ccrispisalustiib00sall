I am the more obliged to use my
utmost endeavours that you may
not be baulked‚ but they may. Ι

kinds. Which ,beforeyourfavours
conferred upon me, Ι did solely

{hall not, to be sure, gentlemen‚
negle& to do, now that I have re-
ceived my reward. It Is a hard
matter to those to keep within any
boxmds, when poffessed of power,
who, to obtain it, only put on a
counterfeit ¹i'hew of goodness. But

days in the pra-{tice of the most
laudable qualities, use is become
second nature. Yoa have com-
:nanded me to make war with Ju-
ςτειιτὼιι, to the great vexation of
the nobility. l beseech you, con-

would not be better to send ‚upon
this, or any other the like occa-
sion, one of the tribe of the nobi-
lity,a man of ‘m ancient and noble
family, and that has never been in
the service of his country abroad.

frighted and confounded in the ,

midst of busmess, for want of exss
perience, get some of the com-
mons to dire& him in his duty.

And so it commonly happens, that the person you have ap-
⁴ pointed to command, is obliged to get some body to com-

mand him.

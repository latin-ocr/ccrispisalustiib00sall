BELLUM CATILINARIUM.

trocinio civitas plurimum
utebatur, rem omnem,
uti cognoverant, aperi-

gam confilio cognito, le-
gatis praecipit, ut studium
conjurationis vehementer
fimulent; caeteros adeant,
bene polliceantur 3 dent-

que operam, ut eos quam'

maxume manifestos ha-
beant.

XLIII. Iisdem ·fere
temporibus, in Gallia ci-
teriore atque ulteriore,
item in agro Piceno,Bru-
tio, Apulia motus erat.
Namque illi, quos ante
Catilina dimiserat, incon-

mentiam, cun&a fimul

liis, armorum atque telo·
rum portationibus, fe-
stinando, agitando omnia,
plus timoris, quam peri-
culi, effecerant„ Ex eo
numero complures Q
Metellus Celer praetor,
ex S C. caussa cognita, in
vincula conjecerat; item
in citeriore Gallia C. Mu-
raena, qui ei provinciae
legatus praeerat.

XLIV. At Romae
Lentulus cum caeteris,
qui ,principes conjuratio-
nis erant, paratis, uti vi-
debatur, magnis copiis,

the ambaſjbdors to pretend a huge
liking and zeal for the conspz'racy‚
to get into the company of the rest
of those concerned in it, promise
their utmost afffionce, and endea-
vour to have [ις plain and ample

XLIII. About the same time,
there was great bqstle in hither
and further Gaul, as alst) in the

up and down, and hage hurry,
and hasty altien, caused more of
fright than danger. A great ma-

BELLUM CATILINARIUM. 67

XXIV. Sed in ea con-
juratione fuit Q Curius,
natus haud obscuro loco,
fla'gitiis atque facinoribus
coopertus; quem censo-
res senatu probri *gratia
moverant. Huic homini
3 non minor vanitas inerat,
quam audacia. Neque re—
ticere quae audierat, neque
suamet ipse scelera occul-
tare3 prorsus nequedicere‚
neque facere, quidquam
penfi habebat. Erat ei
curn Fulvia, muliere no-
bili, stupri vetus confue-
tudo. Cui cum minus
gratus effer, quod inopia
minus largiri poterat, re-
pente glorians, maria
montisque polliceri 3 mi-
nari interdum 'firro, ni
stoi obnoxia foret. Postre-
mo, ferocius agitare, quam
solitus erat. At Fulvia,
insolentiae Curii causa
cognita, tale periculum
reipublicae haud occultum
hahuit3 sed, sublato auc-
tore, de Catilinae conju-
ratione, quae quo modo
audierat, compluribus nar-
·ravit. Ea res in primis
studia hominum accendit
ad consulatum mandan-
dum M. Tullio Ciceroni.
Namque antea pleraque
nobilitas invidia aestuabat,
& quasi pollui consulatum
credebat, ficum, quamvis
egregius, homo novus
. adeptus foret. Sed ubi
periculum advenit, invidia
atque superbia postfuere.

XXIV. Now in this conspi-
racy was engaged Q Curius, de-
scended of no mean family, but a
vile prcy‘ligate wretch‚ whom the
censors,for his scandalous life, had
struck out of the lss of 'the sena-
tors. ‘This man had an equal share
os vanity and impudente 3 was nei-
ther able to contain a secret, nor
even to conceal his own wickccl
prank53 in short, he neither re-
garded what he said, or what he
did. He had an old intrigue with
one Fulvia, a lady of noble birth ς
but declining in favour with her,
by reason of his poverty, which
disabled him from making the pre-
sents fhe expected from him, he be-
gan all on a fitda'en to bounce, and
promise her golden mountains‚
and sometimes threatened to stab
her, if {he would not comply with
his inclinations 3 and, in short,
behaved in a much more sawcy,
haughty manner than he had ever
been used to do before. Fulvia,
when she carne to understand the
occafion of all this insolente, made
no secret af the danger the state
was in, but told to several all she
had heard relating to Catiline's
conspiracy, yet without naming her
author. This discovery made the
people in general zealousfor chzfing
M. Tully Cicero consul. For be-
sore this, almost all the nobility used
to fret with envy, and look upon
the consular dignity as defiled, when
any person of low birth, how ex-
cellently qualified soever he was,
happened to procura the same But
now, upon the appearance of this
danger, envy and pride vanished

a! once·

plebis‚³ concione habita,-
quereretur de actionibus
Ciceronis, bellique gra-
viffumi invidiam optumo
consuli imponeret3 eo
signo, proxuma noete
caetera multitudo conju-
rationis suurn quisque ne-
gotium exsequeretur. Sed

· ea divisa hoc modo dice-

bantur. Statilius & Ga-
binius uti cum magna
manu duodecim simul
opportuna loca urbis in-
cenderent, quo· tumultu
facilior aditus ad consulem
caeterosque, quibus infi-
diae parabantur, fieret.
Cethegus Ciceronis janu-
am obfideret‚ eumque vi
aggrederetur, alius autem
alium. Sed filii familia-
rum,x quorum ex nobili-
tate maxuma pars erat,
parentes interficerent3
simul, caede & incendio
percuifis omnibus, ad
Catilinam erumperent.
Inter haec parata atque
decreta, Cethegus semper
”querebatur de ignavia so-
'ciorum .· Illos, dubitanda
θ’ dies prolatando mag·-
nas opportunitates cor-
rumpere3 salto, non con-
sulto, in tali periculo,
opus effi: Seque, fi pauci
adjuvarent, languentibus
aliis, impetum in cu-
riam facturum. Natura
ferox, vehemens, manu
promptus erat: Maxu-
mum bonum in celeritate
putabat.
